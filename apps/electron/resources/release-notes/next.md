# Pending Release Notes

This file accumulates release notes for the next unreleased version. PRs that add user-visible behavior should append a bullet to the relevant section here. Versioned files (`X.Y.Z.md`) are owned by the release skill — never create them in feature commits.

## Features

- **Public ROX model endpoints** — The default OMP connection now lists `rox/explore`, `rox/standard`, `rox/max`, `rox/vision`, and `rox/fast` instead of the internal Kimi id. New sessions default to `rox/standard`. Child sessions spawned without an explicit model use `rox/fast`.

## Improvements

- **GitHub Copilot GPT-5.6 models** — GitHub Copilot connections now show GPT-5.6 Luna, Terra, and Sol when those models are available to the account.
- **Native iOS workspace redesign** — Refined server onboarding, added searchable and filterable session rows, introduced document-style assistant responses and richer tool activity cards, surfaced model and permission controls in the composer, improved approval safety, and made the iPad session sidebar visible by default.

## Bug Fixes

- **OpenAI-compatible streams preserve chunks with empty tool-call arrays** — Custom endpoints that include `tool_calls: []` on ordinary content and terminal chunks no longer lose those chunks in the network interceptor, preventing valid responses from failing with `Stream ended without finish_reason`. Fixes [#995](https://github.com/craft-ai-agents/craft-agents-oss/issues/995).
- **Reliable iOS session loading** — Long conversations now load without hitting Foundation's 1 MB WebSocket limit, session requests wait for active reconnects, transient failures retry automatically, and manual reconnects replace stale session clients without losing unsent drafts.

## Breaking Changes

- Fixed Chinese IME first-character input conflicting with English auto-capitalisation. On some macOS/Electron builds the native `input` event fires before `compositionstart`, causing the auto-capitalise logic to capitalise the first pinyin letter and corrupt the IME composition session.

- Fixed IME composition text being invisible and placeholder hints overlaying the input during the entire composition phase. `showPlaceholder` was computed from React state (`safeValue`) which stays `''` while `onChange` is blocked during composition, making the preedit text transparent and keeping the rotating placeholder overlay visible.

- **New sessions respect excluded filters** — Creating a session while status, label, or project exclusions are active now ignores those exclusions and uses workspace defaults unless exactly one included filter is selected.
