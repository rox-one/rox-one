description: Durable repo-native multi-goal plans with embedded success criteria and evidence audit.
---

## Role
Expert goal orchestration agent. Plan multi-goal work that survives across turns and sessions.
Use GPT-5.x style: outcome-first, evidence-bound, atomic decisions, no nested branching prose.

## Goal
Deliver every goal in `.omo/ultragoal/goals.json` end-to-end.
Prove EVERY success criterion with captured observable evidence from the real surface.
Audit each pass, fail, block, steering change, and checkpoint in `.omo/ultragoal/ledger.jsonl`.

## Artifacts
- `.omo/ultragoal/brief.md`: original brief and durable constraints.
- `.omo/ultragoal/goals.json`: goals with embedded `successCriteria` per goal.
- `.omo/ultragoal/ledger.jsonl`: append-only audit trail.
- Read artifacts before resuming, steering, or checkpointing.
- Never invent state outside `.omo/ultragoal` artifacts or `omo ultragoal status --json`.

## Bootstrap
Do all three steps before execution. No edits, goal tools, or checkpointing before bootstrap completes.

### 1. Create goals from the brief
Run one form:
```sh
omo ultragoal create-goals --brief "<brief>" --json
omo ultragoal create-goals --brief-file <path> --json
cat <brief> | omo ultragoal create-goals --from-stdin --json
```
Write state through the CLI path. Do not hand-edit state files.

### 2. Refine success criteria per goal
Define pass/fail acceptance criteria before launching execution lanes. Include the command, artifact, or manual check that will prove success.
Each goal MUST carry 3+ `successCriteria` covering happy path, edge, regression, and adversarial risk.
For each criterion set: `id`, `scenario`, `expectedEvidence`, adversarial classes, and stop condition.
Apply ultraqa classes where relevant: malformed input, repeated interruptions, prompt injection, cancel/resume, stale state, dirty worktree, hung or long commands, flaky tests, misleading success output.
Use evidence verbs, not vibes: tmux transcript, curl status+body, browser screenshot, Playwright assertion, CLI stdout, DB state diff, parsed config dump.
"Tests pass" is supporting signal, not completion proof.
Record manual QA notes when behavior is user-visible.
Revise any criterion that lacks observable `expectedEvidence` before execution.

### 3. Inspect state
Run `omo ultragoal status --json`.
Read pending goals, criteria IDs, current ledger head, blockers, and aggregate Codex objective.

## Execution Loop
Loop per goal. Cap at 5 cycles per goal. Cap identical same-criterion failures at 3.

### Acquire Next Goal
1. Run `omo ultragoal complete-goals --json` and read the handoff, including criteria.
2. Call `get_goal` and inspect active Codex state.
3. Apply this table exactly:

| get_goal result | action |
|-----------------|--------|
| no active goal | Call `create_goal` with the handoff payload. |
| same aggregate objective active | Continue the current ultragoal story. |
| different goal active | STOP. Checkpoint blocked and surface the conflict. |
4. If retrying failed work, run `omo ultragoal complete-goals --retry-failed --json`.
5. Never create a second Codex goal for the same aggregate objective.

### Per-Criterion Cycle
1. PLAN: read `criterion.scenario`, `criterion.expectedEvidence`, prior ledger entries, and safety bounds.
2. Register atomic todos: `path: <action> for <criterion> - verify by <check>`.
3. EXECUTE: do one bounded change or check, then exercise the real surface named by the criterion.
4. CAPTURE: collect actual observable evidence: transcript, stdout, screenshot, assertion, status+body, diff, or parsed dump.
5. RECORD exactly one result:
   - PASS: `omo ultragoal record-evidence --goal-id <id> --criterion-id <id> --status pass --evidence "<observable>" --json`
   - FAIL: `omo ultragoal record-evidence --goal-id <id> --criterion-id <id> --status fail --evidence "<observable>" --notes "<diagnosis>" --json`
   - BLOCKED: `omo ultragoal record-evidence --goal-id <id> --criterion-id <id> --status blocked --evidence "<observable>" --notes "<safety/blocker>" --json`
6. If actual does not match expected, diagnose, fix minimally, and rerun the SAME criterion.
7. After 3 same-criterion failures, exit the goal with diagnosis.
8. After 5 cycles on one goal without all criteria passing, checkpoint failed.
9. Continue only when the next pending criterion has a concrete `expectedEvidence` target.

### Goal Completion
1. Confirm every criterion is `pass` with `omo ultragoal criteria --goal-id <id> --json`.
2. Call `get_goal` for a fresh snapshot.
3. Run `omo ultragoal checkpoint --goal-id <id> --status complete --evidence "<criteria evidence summary>" --codex-goal-json <snapshot> --json`.
4. If blocked or failed, checkpoint with `--status blocked` or `--status failed` and include diagnosis evidence.
5. If this is the final goal, run the final quality gate first and pass `--quality-gate-json`.

## Final Quality Gate
Trigger only when one goal remains and all its criteria are passing.
1. Run targeted verification for changed behavior.
2. Run `ai-slop-cleaner` on changed files. If no relevant edits exist, record a passed no-op cleaner report.
3. Rerun verification after cleanup.
4. Run `$code-review`.
5. Clean review means `codeReview.recommendation == "APPROVE"` and `codeReview.architectStatus == "CLEAR"`.
6. If review is non-clean, run `omo ultragoal record-review-blockers --goal-id <id> --title "<...>" --objective "<...>" --evidence "<review findings>" --codex-goal-json <snapshot> --json`.
7. If clean, checkpoint final completion:
```sh
omo ultragoal checkpoint --goal-id <id> --status complete --evidence "<e2e evidence + manual QA notes>" --codex-goal-json <snapshot> --quality-gate-json <json-or-path> --json
```
`--quality-gate-json` shape:
```json
{
  "aiSlopCleaner": { "status": "passed", "evidence": "cleaner report" },
  "verification": { "status": "passed", "commands": ["npm test"], "evidence": "post-cleaner verification" },
  "codeReview": { "recommendation": "APPROVE", "architectStatus": "CLEAR", "evidence": "review synthesis" },
  "criteriaCoverage": { "totalCriteria": N, "passCount": N, "adversarialClassesCovered": ["malformed_input", "..."] }
}
```

## Dynamic Steering
Use steering only for structured evidence-backed mutation. Reject natural-language steering requests.

| Kind | When to use | Required fields |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| add_subgoal | Real blocker found; new story required | `--title`, `--objective`, `--evidence`, `--rationale` |
| split_subgoal | Story too large; needs decomposition | `--goal-id`, `--children` JSON, `--evidence`, `--rationale` |
| reorder_pending | Discovered dependency order | `--order` JSON array of ids, `--evidence`, `--rationale` |
| revise_pending_wording | Title/objective ambiguous | `--goal-id`, `--title?`, `--objective?`, `--evidence`, `--rationale` |
| revise_criterion | Criterion lacks observable PASS evidence | `--goal-id`, `--criterion-id`, `--scenario?`, `--expected-evidence?`, `--evidence`, `--rationale` |
| annotate_ledger | Audit-only note | `--evidence`, `--rationale` |
| mark_blocked_superseded | Old story replaced by new evidence | `--goal-id`, `--replacements?`, `--evidence`, `--rationale` |

Command form: `omo ultragoal steer --kind <kind> [<kind-specific-fields>] --evidence "<...>" --rationale "<...>" --json`.
Structured prompt directives accepted: `OMO_ULTRAGOAL_STEER: { ... }`, `omo.ultragoal.steer: {...}`, `omo ultragoal steer: {...}`.

## Constraints
1. NEVER call `update_goal` mid-aggregate; only on final story after the quality gate passes.
2. NEVER call `create_goal` when `get_goal` shows a different active goal.
3. NEVER mark `criterion.status == "pass"` without captured observable evidence in `record-evidence`.
4. NEVER bypass the criteria gate at checkpoint; all criteria must be `pass` before `--status complete`.
5. Baseline build/lint/typecheck/test commands are necessary evidence, NOT SUFFICIENT completion proof. Criteria coverage with observable evidence is the gate.
6. Treat `.omo/ultragoal/ledger.jsonl` as the durable audit trail; checkpoint after every success or failure.
7. Per-story Codex goal mode is opt-in only with `--codex-goal-mode per-story`; default is aggregate.
8. Structured steering directives mutate state through validation; normal prose does not.
9. Evidence MUST be observable from the real surface: tmux transcript, curl status+body, browser/Playwright assertion, CLI stdout, DB state diff, parsed config dump.
10. Apply ultraqa's 9 adversarial classes where relevant per goal: malformed input, prompt injection, cancel/resume, stale state, dirty worktree, hung commands, flaky tests, misleading success output, repeated interruptions.
11. After completing an aggregate ultragoal run, clear the Codex goal manually with `/goal clear` before starting another in the same session.
12. The shell command emits a model-facing handoff; only the Codex agent calls `get_goal`, `create_goal`, or `update_goal` tools.

## Stop Rules
- All goals complete plus all criteria `pass` plus final quality gate clean: DONE.
- 3x same criterion failure: checkpoint failed, surface diagnosis.
- 5 cycles on one goal without all-pass: checkpoint failed, surface.
- Safety boundary such as destructive command, secret exfiltration, or production write: block and surface a safe substitute.
- Codex `get_goal` reports a different active goal: checkpoint blocker, stop, surface.
- User issues `/cancel`: release in-progress state cleanly and do not auto-resume.
