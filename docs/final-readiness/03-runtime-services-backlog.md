# [SVC] Runtime, services and shared-module final-readiness backlog

**Current scope:** Historical `main` findings below are retained as the baseline. Each task now carries branch reconciliation and remaining work. Read [09 — source reconciliation](09-source-reconciliation.md) and the latest candidate checks before assigning implementation. A baseline gap may already have a branch implementation.

**Audited source:** `rox-one/rox-one` main at `f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12`. **Targets:** A = Windows 10 and Windows 11; B = macOS; C = hosted web app. **Scope:** backend/server services, subprocess runtimes, cloud execution, integrations and shared storage/business modules. Screen-specific work and overall integration/release gates are documented in the companion backlog files.

This is a source audit and implementation backlog. “Observed” means visible in the pinned source. “Verification requirement” identifies a capability already present in code that still needs complete packaged/hosted functional evidence; it does not imply that every named behavior is currently broken. No paid cloud provisioning, live messaging, mail delivery or account integration was exercised during this document's source inspection. Existing tests are entry points for future acceptance, not proof of a final production build.

## [SVC-ARCH] Actual service topology

| Component | Process / deployment boundary | Responsibilities and dependencies | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Desktop/server shared core | Library running inside Electron main or Bun headless server | SessionManager, RPC handlers, tasks, memory, knowledge, pages, native/OpenClaw/workflow services. Depends on shared/core/session-tools/cloud-runner, `ws`, `jose`, `sharp`, Turso database and Transformers. | [packages/server-core/package.json:1–47](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/package.json#L1-L47) |
| Standalone headless server | Bun process; HTTP and WebSocket on a configured public/local origin | Loads runtime assets, WebUI, provider credentials, messaging bootstrap, OAuth callback and session manager. This is a deployable server, not a static frontend. | [packages/server/src/index.ts:119–170](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server/src/index.ts#L119-L170); [packages/server/package.json:1–38](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server/package.json#L1-L38) |
| WebUI auth/HTTP | Embedded Node adapter or standalone Bun HTTP handler | Static WebUI delivery, password login, signed cookie, health, OAuth completion.

| Cloud runner active registry | Daytona remote sandbox, local child or native sidecar | Public active providers are `daytona | local | native`. Local defaults to a reference stub. Daytona uses a thin HTTP control-plane client and expects `rox-run` inside the sandbox. | [packages/cloud-runner/src/public-registry.ts:2–21](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/public-registry.ts#L2-L21); [packages/cloud-runner/src/local-provider.ts:133–136](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/local-provider.ts#L133-L136); [packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts:332–340](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts#L332-L340) |
| Cloudflare gateway legacy | Worker + RunAgent Durable Objects + container/workspace binding | Retained in source; retired from normal public registry. Uses shared bearer token v1 and has separate artifact/share routes. Default Wrangler configuration permits up to 100 container instances. | [apps/cloud-gateway/src/index.ts:11–37](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/apps/cloud-gateway/src/index.ts#L11-L37); [apps/cloud-gateway/wrangler.jsonc:7–34](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/apps/cloud-gateway/wrangler.jsonc#L7-L34) |

| Default “microservices” | Folder-source configuration, not independent daemons | Notes, memory, sessions, tasks, projects, workspace tree, applications and Telegram-support directories; applications/Telegram paths are macOS-specific and folder pointers are marked connected in seed config. | [packages/shared/src/sources/default-microservices.ts:2–6](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/sources/default-microservices.ts#L2-L6); [packages/shared/src/sources/default-microservices.ts:76–96](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/sources/default-microservices.ts#L76-L96); [packages/shared/src/sources/default-microservices.ts:117–126](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/sources/default-microservices.ts#L117-L126) |

A hosted deployment needs persistent workspace/config/session/credential/queue stores, an actual authenticated server, runtime assets, per-tenant execution ownership and optional external integrations. A static web bundle cannot supply local filesystem access, Node workers, OS keychains, OMP/Pi children or the knowledge kernel. These capabilities execute on the server or an authenticated desktop companion.

## [SVC-PRIORITY] Confirmed gaps with highest release impact

1. Hosted WebUI has shared-password identity, not account-specific authentication ([SVC-002]).
2. Daytona `exec()` return value is ignored before `state='done'` ([SVC-012]).
3. Paid Daytona gate helper is disabled but normal live RPC factory constructs the provider separately; enforce and prove all-path gating ([SVC-013]).
4. Local runner defaults to test/reference stub output ([SVC-014]).
5. Replica persistence/transport and organization/team remote transport are not complete ([SVC-027], [SVC-028]).
6. Windows secure-storage new master key lacks OS-keychain branch; OpenClaw audit refuses Windows child spawning pending ownership ([SVC-009], [SVC-037]).
7. Desktop Electron memory full-text search explicitly falls back because `bun:sqlite` is unavailable ([SVC-025]).
8. Managed knowledge, public publication and paid sandbox release gates remain intentionally closed in their respective modules; final product claims must match enforced capability ([SVC-013], [SVC-024], [SVC-029]).
9. ROX-only token alias WebUI startup and standalone MCP credential-aware tool behavior need regression proof ([SVC-001], [SVC-008]).

## [SVC-BACKLOG] Tasks and subtasks

Dependencies: complete identity/tenant isolation ([SVC-002]) before multi-user services ([SVC-027]–[SVC-029]); complete credential/source/permission boundaries ([SVC-007]–[SVC-011], [SVC-035]) before enabling cloud/workflow/page execution; complete actual provider outcomes ([SVC-012]–[SVC-014]) before reporting cloud quests/publications as completed. All targets require final packaged/deployed acceptance in addition to package tests.

### [SVC-001] Production server bootstrap and HTTP/WebSocket configuration

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Bun/headless bootstrap now registers durable native authority/journal and strict shutdown; core recovery provides real three-artifact lifecycle proof. ROX/CRAFT token alias inconsistency remains in WebUI server setup.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Unify environment aliases; validate production HTTPS/proxy/callback configuration and reproducible WebUI staging. Relative output workaround is documented; absolute output handling still needs repair.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server/src/index.ts#L119-L156); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/bootstrap/headless-start.ts#L391-L434); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/bootstrap/headless-start.ts#L442-L480); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server/src/index.ts#L119-L156)


**Status:** Observed configuration inconsistency; end-to-end launch unverified. **Targets:** A/B: packaged local service; C: authoritative hosted service.

Resolve server environment names through one validated configuration path. WebUI bootstrap currently reads CRAFT_SERVER_TOKEN directly, while headless bootstrap accepts ROX_SERVER_TOKEN. Make web assets, ports, TLS and runtime assets deterministic.

**Code references:** [packages/server/src/index.ts:119–156](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server/src/index.ts#L119-L156); [packages/server-core/src/bootstrap/headless-start.ts:391–434](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/bootstrap/headless-start.ts#L391-L434).

**Requirements:** ROX and legacy CRAFT aliases behave consistently; startup reports missing assets or invalid ports without exposing secrets.

**DoD:** Both aliases independently start authenticated HTTP and RPC, and an invalid configuration fails before accepting clients.

**Full functional verification:** Boot from a clean data directory, log in, connect RPC, run a session, restart and reopen it.

**Test method:** Subprocess startup matrix plus browser smoke against the built server.

#### [SVC-001.1] Canonical environment aliases and startup diagnostics

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Bun/headless bootstrap now registers durable native authority/journal and strict shutdown; core recovery provides real three-artifact lifecycle proof. ROX/CRAFT token alias inconsistency remains in WebUI server setup.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate and verify the original subtask outcome for 'Canonical environment aliases and startup diagnostics', reusing the parent source changes. Complete only the requirements not already implemented, then execute the full acceptance below. Unify environment aliases; validate production HTTPS/proxy/callback configuration and reproducible WebUI staging.

Implement a shared resolved token/port/path configuration for WebUI and bootstrap; verify an ROX-only environment actually enables login. **Targets:** A/B: packaged local service; C: authoritative hosted service.

**Code references:** [packages/server/src/index.ts:119–156](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server/src/index.ts#L119-L156); [packages/server-core/src/bootstrap/headless-start.ts:391–434](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/bootstrap/headless-start.ts#L391-L434).

**Requirements:** ROX-only, CRAFT-only and both-defined precedence documented.

**DoD:** Each supported configuration starts the same authenticated surfaces.

**Full functional verification:** Start three isolated servers and read /login, /health and WebSocket handshake.

**Test method:** Extend server smoke tests with alias-only subprocess cases.

#### [SVC-001.2] Deploy HTTP, RPC and OAuth under the public origin

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Bun/headless bootstrap now registers durable native authority/journal and strict shutdown; core recovery provides real three-artifact lifecycle proof. ROX/CRAFT token alias inconsistency remains in WebUI server setup.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate and verify the original subtask outcome for 'Deploy HTTP, RPC and OAuth under the public origin', reusing the parent source changes.

Validate public WebSocket URL, HTTPS termination, forwarded host/protocol and secure cookies; headless supports embedded HTTP/WSS or a separate Bun HTTP port. **Targets:** A/B: packaged local service; C: authoritative hosted service.

**Code references:** [packages/server/src/index.ts:119–156](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server/src/index.ts#L119-L156); [packages/server-core/src/bootstrap/headless-start.ts:391–434](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/bootstrap/headless-start.ts#L391-L434).

**Requirements:** Production URL and proxy allowlist explicitly configured.

**DoD:** No mixed-content or localhost callback URLs appear to remote browsers.

**Full functional verification:** Login through production-shaped TLS proxy and finish an OAuth redirect.

**Test method:** WebUI HTTP tests plus actual proxy/browser integration.

### [SVC-002] Hosted identity, tenancy and authorization

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Native authenticated principal, workspace grants, registered scopes, before-response fences and invalidation sockets are implemented for approved native/domain operations. Shared WebUI password remains JWT subject webui; generic hosted account/tenant sessions are not solved.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Implement account-specific hosted identity and durable tenant-scoped sessions, then adversarial cross-account/source/file/event tests. Preserve native subject/issuer authorization instead of replacing it with renderer-supplied identity.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/webui/auth.ts#L16-L49); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts#L116-L143); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/security/workspace-scope.ts#L77-L116); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts#L738-L790); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/handlers/rpc/orgs.ts#L53-L90); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/webui/auth.ts#L35-L65)


**Status:** Observed single shared WebUI identity; multi-user readiness gap. **Targets:** A/B: preserve local-owner behavior; C: implement hosted account isolation.

WebUI currently signs every login with sub='webui' after one configured password. Introduce authenticated user/account identity and durable workspace membership; propagate identity into HTTP, RPC, events, downloads and tool ownership.

**Code references:** [packages/server-core/src/webui/auth.ts:16–49](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/webui/auth.ts#L16-L49); [packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts:116–143](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts#L116-L143); [packages/server-core/src/security/workspace-scope.ts:77–116](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/security/workspace-scope.ts#L77-L116).

**Requirements:** Every hosted request has a validated account subject and resource authorization; renderer IDs never establish ownership.

**DoD:** Two accounts cannot read, mutate, subscribe to or execute against each other's resources.

**Full functional verification:** Create two users and workspaces, exchange all known IDs, attempt RPC calls and event subscriptions, and verify denied audit records.

**Test method:** HTTP/RPC adversarial tenancy suite using real signed sessions.

#### [SVC-002.1] Account sessions and revocation

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Native authenticated principal, workspace grants, registered scopes, before-response fences and invalidation sockets are implemented for approved native/domain operations. Shared WebUI password remains JWT subject webui; generic hosted account/tenant sessions are not solved.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate and verify the original subtask outcome for 'Account sessions and revocation', reusing the parent source changes. Complete only the requirements not already implemented, then execute the full acceptance below. Implement account-specific hosted identity and durable tenant-scoped sessions, then adversarial cross-account/source/file/event tests. Preserve native subject/issuer authorization instead of replacing it with renderer-supplied identity.

Replace shared hosted login with account-specific sessions, key rotation and server-side revocation; distinguish device bearer tokens from browser sessions. **Targets:** A/B: preserve local-owner behavior; C: implement hosted account isolation.

**Code references:** [packages/server-core/src/webui/auth.ts:16–49](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/webui/auth.ts#L16-L49); [packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts:116–143](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts#L116-L143); [packages/server-core/src/security/workspace-scope.ts:77–116](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/security/workspace-scope.ts#L77-L116).

**Requirements:** Expiry, logout/revoke and role change apply to HTTP and WSS.

**DoD:** Revoked identities lose access even on existing sockets.

**Full functional verification:** Log in on two devices, revoke one and retry reads and writes.

**Test method:** Session lifecycle integration tests with connected sockets.

#### [SVC-002.2] Audit every resource route and push subscription

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Native authenticated principal, workspace grants, registered scopes, before-response fences and invalidation sockets are implemented for approved native/domain operations.

Inventory HANDLED_CHANNELS and apply authoritative membership checks to sessions, files, cloud runs, knowledge, credentials, orgs, pages and messaging. **Targets:** A/B: preserve local-owner behavior; C: implement hosted account isolation.

**Code references:** [packages/server-core/src/webui/auth.ts:16–49](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/webui/auth.ts#L16-L49); [packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts:116–143](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts#L116-L143); [packages/server-core/src/security/workspace-scope.ts:77–116](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/security/workspace-scope.ts#L77-L116).

**Requirements:** Authorization before lookup, mutation and subscription.

**DoD:** Cross-account requests are denied without leaking resource metadata.

**Full functional verification:** Replay another account's request payloads and monitor every push topic.

**Test method:** Table-driven channel authorization tests plus two-user browser test.

### [SVC-003] RPC compatibility, reconnect and remote capability routing

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Acknowledged workspace bootstrap, capability declarations, native-action metadata, permission fences and shared replay path have been added. Generic shared push deliberately returns CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE; unavailable rendering was not accepted as functionality.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Validate all client/server combinations, refresh/revoke during an in-flight reply, durable reconnect/replay and per-domain capability routing. Define explicit unavailable behavior for desktop-only capabilities in hosted WebUI.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts#L250-L292); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/transport/client.ts#L979-L1040); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/runtime/platform-headless.ts#L1-L7); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts#L309-L440); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/transport/client.ts#L1-L90)


**Status:** Verification requirement for existing transport. **Targets:** A/B: Electron local binding; C: browser/server capabilities.

Certify handshake compatibility, replay ordering, bounded disconnected-client buffers and local-only channel filtering. Headless GUI methods are intentionally absent, so remote capabilities must return meaningful supported results.

**Code references:** [packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts:250–292](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts#L250-L292); [packages/server-core/src/transport/client.ts:979–1040](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/transport/client.ts#L979-L1040); [packages/server-core/src/runtime/platform-headless.ts:1–7](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/runtime/platform-headless.ts#L1-L7).

**Requirements:** Version compatibility, capability availability, timeout and replay semantics documented.

**DoD:** A reconnecting client neither loses durable state nor performs a protected local Electron action.

**Full functional verification:** Interrupt the connection during streaming, permission prompts and client callbacks; reconnect and compare authoritative transcripts.

**Test method:** Transport lifecycle/peer-trust/error-code suites plus network fault browser tests.

#### [SVC-003.1] Reconnect and bounded replay under load

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Requirements:** Buffers and client limits stay bounded under disconnect churn.

**DoD:** No duplicate final message or unreleased pending invocation remains.

**Full functional verification:** Disconnect repeatedly with concurrent sessions and inspect sequence/state.

**Test method:** Load/fault harness around WsRpcServer and WsRpcClient.

#### [SVC-003.2] Capability parity for hosted browsers

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

Map absent GUI methods to browser download, upload, external-link and remote-browser behavior or explicit unavailable states. **Targets:** A/B: Electron local binding; C: browser/server capabilities.

**Code references:** [packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts:250–292](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/transport/server.ts#L250-L292); [packages/server-core/src/transport/client.ts:979–1040](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/transport/client.ts#L979-L1040); [packages/server-core/src/runtime/platform-headless.ts:1–7](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/runtime/platform-headless.ts#L1-L7).

**Requirements:** Only negotiated capability clients receive callbacks.

**DoD:** Every exposed operation returns a visible result or actionable error.

**Full functional verification:** Exercise file open/export and browser actions from all target clients.

**Test method:** RPC capability tests plus Win/mac/hosted functional matrix.

### [SVC-004] Agent runtime delivery and provider compatibility

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** OMP first-run model/auth bridge, framing and lifecycle hardening plus durable provider budget integration are present. Pi reasoning registration regressions were corrected in core recovery. These do not prove live provider accounts or installed runtime delivery.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate one reviewed runtime revision and its artifact manifest; execute streaming/tools/cancellation/usage with real supported providers on Windows, macOS and hosted server. Reconcile dirty OMP18.4.12 upgrade against committed managed17.2.10 before adoption.

**Status:** Three implemented backends; production runtime certification required. **Targets:** A/B: ship native/runtime binaries; C: execute on tenant-owned server workers.

Certify Claude, Pi and OMP startup, model validation, streaming, abort, mini completions, tool calls and provider credential routing. Their presence in the factory is not proof that packaged runtimes are usable.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts:65–69](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts#L65-L69); [packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts:135–151](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts#L135-L151); [packages/pi-agent-server/package.json:11–28](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/pi-agent-server/package.json#L11-L28).

**Requirements:** Pinned compatible runtime versions; no implicit dependency on a developer's PATH or home configuration.

**DoD:** All offered backends complete a real conversation and tool call on each supported execution host.

**Full functional verification:** Install on clean machines/containers, authenticate, run text/tool/vision turns and force a runtime crash.

**Test method:** Backend factory/runtime resolver suites plus real-provider acceptance runs.

Verify SDK CLI, Pi server bundle, Bun/Node, OMP and ripgrep paths for Windows 10/11 and both macOS architectures. **Targets:** A/B: ship native/runtime binaries; C: execute on tenant-owned server workers.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts:65–69](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts#L65-L69); [packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts:135–151](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts#L135-L151); [packages/pi-agent-server/package.json:11–28](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/pi-agent-server/package.json#L11-L28).

**Requirements:** Architecture-specific executables and clear missing-runtime errors.

**DoD:** All shipped runtimes launch without globally installed development tools.

**Full functional verification:** Launch under a minimal environment and a path with spaces/non-ASCII text.

**Test method:** Packaged runtime smoke tests and binary manifest inspection.

#### [SVC-004.2] Provider capability and model failure handling

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** OMP first-run model/auth bridge, framing and lifecycle hardening plus durable provider budget integration are present. Pi reasoning registration regressions were corrected in core recovery. These do not prove live provider accounts or installed runtime delivery.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate and verify the original subtask outcome for 'Provider capability and model failure handling', reusing the parent source changes. Complete only the requirements not already implemented, then execute the full acceptance below. Integrate one reviewed runtime revision and its artifact manifest; execute streaming/tools/cancellation/usage with real supported providers on Windows, macOS and hosted server.

Test unsupported model/auth combinations, throttling, revoked auth, model retirement and unavailable mini-model fallback. **Targets:** A/B: ship native/runtime binaries; C: execute on tenant-owned server workers.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts:65–69](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts#L65-L69); [packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts:135–151](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts#L135-L151); [packages/pi-agent-server/package.json:11–28](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/pi-agent-server/package.json#L11-L28).

**Requirements:** Provider-specific errors remain actionable and safely redacted.

**DoD:** Streaming/abort/tool and query paths preserve consistent session state.

**Full functional verification:** Run a supported provider then simulate 401, 429 and retired models.

**Test method:** Driver tests plus isolated live-provider contract tests.

### [SVC-005] OMP host tools, branching and permission round trips

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Committed OMP RPCv2 decoder enforces frame/reassembly bounds and lifecycle tests. Dirty original audit checkout adds a distinct omp-rpc-frames decoder and negotiate_protocol handling; it has no committed acceptance receipt.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Finish actual OMP host tool callbacks, permission approve/deny, source status, branch/resume/cancel and transcript replay. Verify tool subprocess cwd/env and source authorization on each platform; integrate dirty protocol work only after comparison and tests.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts#L4-L19); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts#L87-L99); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/AGENTS.md#L12-L46); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/shared/src/agent/omp-rpc-transport.ts#L1-L100); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/shared/src/agent/omp-agent.ts#L1-L100)


**Status:** Existing OMP integration; parity verification required. **Targets:** A/B: local OMP process; C: per-tenant OMP runner.

Certify OMP NDJSON host-tool dispatch, essential tool visibility, source refresh at idle points, thinking events, branch anchors, skills and mirrored transcripts. Preserve Craft transcript authority and deny on unanswered permissions.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts:4–19](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts#L4-L19); [packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts:87–99](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts#L87-L99); [AGENTS.md:12–46](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/AGENTS.md#L12-L46).

**Requirements:** Ask/safe/allow-all modes enforce the same policy as Pi/Claude, including source tools and shadowed host bash.

**DoD:** Source changes and branch/resume produce correct context without unauthorized execution.

**Full functional verification:** Run source read/write, change permissions mid-session, fork before the last turn and reopen after process restart.

**Test method:** OMP transport, source-proxy, anchors and permission tests plus live CLI harness.

#### [SVC-005.1] Host tools and extension responses

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Committed OMP RPCv2 decoder enforces frame/reassembly bounds and lifecycle tests. Dirty original audit checkout adds a distinct omp-rpc-frames decoder and negotiate_protocol handling; it has no committed acceptance receipt.

Exercise host_tool_call/result, extension_ui_request/response, schema errors, cancellation and timeout paths. **Targets:** A/B: local OMP process; C: per-tenant OMP runner.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts:4–19](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts#L4-L19); [packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts:87–99](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts#L87-L99); [AGENTS.md:12–46](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/AGENTS.md#L12-L46).

**Requirements:** Every extension request receives a valid protocol response.

**DoD:** No hung process, hidden essential tool or permission bypass.

**Full functional verification:** Trigger prompts with accept, reject, no answer and UI disconnect.

**Test method:** NDJSON protocol fixture suite and real OMP tool runs.

#### [SVC-005.2] Branch, skills and transcript recovery

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Committed OMP RPCv2 decoder enforces frame/reassembly bounds and lifecycle tests. Dirty original audit checkout adds a distinct omp-rpc-frames decoder and negotiate_protocol handling; it has no committed acceptance receipt.

Validate sidecar anchors, switch_session/branch handshakes, tail forks, imported skills and restoration from Craft history. **Targets:** A/B: local OMP process; C: per-tenant OMP runner.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts:4–19](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts#L4-L19); [packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts:87–99](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts#L87-L99); [AGENTS.md:12–46](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/AGENTS.md#L12-L46).

**Requirements:** Stable parent/child provenance and correct skill activation.

**DoD:** Reopened branches contain intended history and no future parent turns.

**Full functional verification:** Fork at middle/tail, kill OMP, reopen both branches and compare context.

**Test method:** Anchor/branch/skill discovery tests plus restart acceptance.

### [SVC-006] Pi agent server lifecycle, search and web fetch

**Reconciled implementation:** verification_still_required — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Core recovery retains canonical Pi reasoning registration with targeted callback tests and built subprocess/server lifecycle proof. Candidate typecheck now passes. Search service changes improve scoped behavior but no live web-fetch/search provider receipt closes the whole service.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Run actual Pi subprocess on supported OSs; validate search and SSRF/redirect/timeout limits, tool permissions, crash cleanup and provider configuration. Keep provider account acceptance separate from compiler/lifecycle proof.

**Status:** Implemented subprocess; external-provider and SSRF verification required. **Targets:** A/B: bundled Pi child; C: sandboxed tenant worker.

Validate JSONL framing, ephemeral-query cleanup, per-session model/auth settings, controlled bash and web/search behavior. Search has provider/model fallbacks; web fetch has protocol/private-IP and size guards that require redirect/DNS abuse testing.

**Code references:** [packages/pi-agent-server/src/index.ts:1–60](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/pi-agent-server/src/index.ts#L1-L60); [packages/pi-agent-server/src/tools/web-fetch.ts:68–126](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/pi-agent-server/src/tools/web-fetch.ts#L68-L126); [packages/pi-agent-server/src/tools/search/SEARCH_PAYLOAD_CONTRACT.md:1–28](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/pi-agent-server/src/tools/search/SEARCH_PAYLOAD_CONTRACT.md#L1-L28).

**Requirements:** Subprocess output is framed; web/search limits and permitted egress are enforceable on the execution host.

**DoD:** One tenant cannot influence another runtime's credential/model/tool configuration; invalid fetches cannot reach private infrastructure.

**Full functional verification:** Run long streaming sessions and ephemeral queries while canceling; test search failures and malicious URL redirects.

**Test method:** Pi lifecycle/search suites plus real HTTP DNS/redirect fixture server.

#### [SVC-006.1] Runtime cancellation and subprocess resource cleanup

Exercise OAuth/API search, model fallback, PDF/text/download extraction and redirect/DNS rebinding guards. **Targets:** A/B: bundled Pi child; C: sandboxed tenant worker.

**Code references:** [packages/pi-agent-server/src/index.ts:1–60](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/pi-agent-server/src/index.ts#L1-L60); [packages/pi-agent-server/src/tools/web-fetch.ts:68–126](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/pi-agent-server/src/tools/web-fetch.ts#L68-L126); [packages/pi-agent-server/src/tools/search/SEARCH_PAYLOAD_CONTRACT.md:1–28](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/pi-agent-server/src/tools/search/SEARCH_PAYLOAD_CONTRACT.md#L1-L28).

**Requirements:** Bounded retries, content size, output and wall time; artifacts stay session-contained.

**DoD:** Correct results on supported content and safe errors on forbidden URLs.

**Full functional verification:** Search with each configured provider and fetch oversized/private/redirected content.

**Test method:** Search provider tests plus hostile fetch integration cases.

### [SVC-007] Shared source tools, MCP pooling and credential refresh

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Source RPCs gained workspace authorization and source-status runtime tests; secure storage strict reads/repair state reduce silent cached-secret behavior. Shared source execution, MCP pool and real token refresh still require provider acceptance.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Finish tenant-scoped source ownership/permission propagation, OAuth refresh/revoke and connector health. Verify MCP reconnect and cancellation with real local/remote transports and no secret data in renderer/logs.

**Status:** Existing integration; cross-backend and multi-tenant verification required. **Targets:** A/B: local stdio and remote sources; C: remote sources/server-side stdio only.

Certify HTTP, legacy SSE, stdio MCP and API proxy sources across all backends. Pool sharing must never cross credential/tenant boundaries; browser filesystem access must not be confused with server-local sources.

**Requirements:** Source enablement, grants, expiry and transport configuration enforced at invocation.

**DoD:** Add/connect/read/write/disable/delete and credential renewal work across all visible source types.

**Full functional verification:** Configure one source per transport, use two sessions, rotate its token and disable during an in-flight call.

**Test method:** Source builder/token-refresh/API credential suites plus fixture MCP servers.

#### [SVC-007.1] Connection lifecycle and per-tenant pool isolation

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Source RPCs gained workspace authorization and source-status runtime tests; secure storage strict reads/repair state reduce silent cached-secret behavior. Shared source execution, MCP pool and real token refresh still require provider acceptance.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate and verify the original subtask outcome for 'Connection lifecycle and per-tenant pool isolation', reusing the parent source changes. Complete only the requirements not already implemented, then execute the full acceptance below.

**Requirements:** A disabled or deleted source becomes unusable promptly.

**DoD:** Tool names and runtime availability match authoritative source state.

**Full functional verification:** Rename/remove sources while Pi/OMP/Claude sessions are open.

**Test method:** MCP pool integration tests with two workspaces and auth-separated servers.

#### [SVC-007.2] API authentication and dynamic token freshness

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Source RPCs gained workspace authorization and source-status runtime tests; secure storage strict reads/repair state reduce silent cached-secret behavior. Shared source execution, MCP pool and real token refresh still require provider acceptance.

Test OAuth, bearer, basic, multi-header and renew-endpoint authentication without decrypted cache files. **Targets:** A/B: local stdio and remote sources; C: remote sources/server-side stdio only.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/mcp/mcp-pool.ts:1–14](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/mcp/mcp-pool.ts#L1-L14); [packages/shared/src/mcp/mcp-pool.ts:62–72](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/mcp/mcp-pool.ts#L62-L72); [packages/shared/src/sources/server-builder.ts:2–38](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/sources/server-builder.ts#L2-L38).

**Requirements:** Secrets resolved for the actual request and redacted in diagnostics.

**DoD:** Expired credentials refresh once and tool retries safely.

**Full functional verification:** Expire each credential shape and inspect fixture request headers/logs.

**Test method:** Existing source auth/refresh/log-redaction tests plus end-to-end request capture.

### [SVC-008] Session tools and standalone session MCP parity

**Reconciled implementation:** verification_still_required — source_inspected_or_compiler_only.

**Observed branch progress:** Candidate session-tools/session-MCP compilers pass; generic standalone credential-cache bridge remains bounded and is not replaced by the new native Notes sync/replica service.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Resolve standalone MCP credential/auth context, enumerate parity with in-app session tools, and verify no cross-workspace session reads/writes. Exercise real MCP clients, reconnect/cancel and destructive permission gates.

**Status:** Observed disabled credential-cache adapter; credential-aware operations need traced verification. **Targets:** A/B: local MCP child; C: trusted server callback channel.

Standalone session MCP readCredentialCache always returns null after cache retirement, and its manager cannot refresh. Trace each credential-aware tool to the live host callback or implement a scoped broker so those operations remain usable without restoring plaintext caches.

**Code references:** [packages/session-mcp-server/src/index.ts:61–111](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/session-mcp-server/src/index.ts#L61-L111); [packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts:61–99](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/session-tool-defs.ts#L61-L99); [packages/session-tools-core/package.json:15–24](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/session-tools-core/package.json#L15-L24).

**Requirements:** Session tool parity is behavioral across Claude/Pi/OMP/standalone MCP; credentials stay in trusted host memory/storage.

**DoD:** Every advertised tool has a working implementation or is excluded with an explicit reason.

**Full functional verification:** List tool definitions and exercise source auth/test, plans, browser, spawn_session and call_llm through each backend.

**Test method:** Registry parity suite plus standalone MCP stdio integration.

#### [SVC-008.1] Replace null credential adapter with scoped host access

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Requirements:** No decrypted credential cache is recreated.

**DoD:** Credential-aware source checks pass using encrypted host-managed auth.

**Full functional verification:** Authenticate a source and invoke checks via standalone session MCP.

**Test method:** MCP child/host round-trip tests with token refresh and denied scope.

#### [SVC-008.2] Callback timeout, error and permission parity

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Candidate session-tools/session-MCP compilers pass; generic standalone credential-cache bridge remains bounded and is not replaced by the new native Notes sync/replica service.

**Requirements:** Callbacks bind to the originating session and workspace.

**DoD:** No stale callback can authorize a different session.

**Full functional verification:** Interleave callbacks from two sessions; timeout one and close its owner.

**Test method:** Session tool registry/callback integration and permission denial tests.

### [SVC-009] Credentials, master keys and managed credential grants

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Credential locator validation is hardened against prototype/accessor/non-enumerable/symbol records; credential storage has strict disk reads, quarantine/repair and durable writes. Replica key handling and grant-related source changes are present. Windows protected master-key custody is not added by these repairs.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Deliver Windows/macOS key custody and loss/recovery behavior; verify grants/import/scope/revoke using real OS stores. Do not count successful SQLite porting as secret-store protection.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/credentials/backends/secure-storage.ts#L124-L184); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/credentials/fabric/broker.ts#L1-L80); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/credentials/fabric/infisical-provider.ts#L144-L155); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/shared/src/credentials/types.ts#L225-L255); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/shared/src/credentials/backends/secure-storage.ts#L365-L408)


**Status:** Observed no Windows OS-keychain branch for current master key; production security gap. **Targets:** A: DPAPI/Credential Manager or enforced ACL fallback; B: Keychain; C: managed secret/KMS and tenant stores.

Current master-key read/write supports macOS and Linux then a credentials.key fallback; Windows MachineGuid applies to legacy derivation, not protected new key storage. Add a documented Windows protected-key path and certify recovery/migration/credential grant enforcement.

**Requirements:** Secrets encrypted at rest; master-key protection, recovery and grant scope defined per platform.

**DoD:** Valid credentials survive restart/migration; missing keys never silently discard existing secrets or broaden grants.

**Full functional verification:** Create/read/migrate/rollback credentials and test revoked grants, tenant mismatch and unavailable key stores.

**Test method:** Secure-storage/master-key/migration/fabric policy suites plus OS-native storage tests.

#### [SVC-009.1] Protect Windows and hosted master keys

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Credential locator validation is hardened against prototype/accessor/non-enumerable/symbol records; credential storage has strict disk reads, quarantine/repair and durable writes. Replica key handling and grant-related source changes are present. Windows protected master-key custody is not added by these repairs.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate and verify the original subtask outcome for 'Protect Windows and hosted master keys', reusing the parent source changes. Complete only the requirements not already implemented, then execute the full acceptance below. Deliver Windows/macOS key custody and loss/recovery behavior; verify grants/import/scope/revoke using real OS stores. Do not count successful SQLite porting as secret-store protection.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/credentials/backends/secure-storage.ts:124–184](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/credentials/backends/secure-storage.ts#L124-L184); [packages/shared/src/credentials/fabric/broker.ts:1–80](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/credentials/fabric/broker.ts#L1-L80); [packages/shared/src/credentials/fabric/infisical-provider.ts:144–155](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/credentials/fabric/infisical-provider.ts#L144-L155).

**Requirements:** Server-authorized grants specify resource, capability and expiry.

**DoD:** Revoked/expired/wrong-project grants fail before materialization.

**Full functional verification:** Import each available provider, revoke it and retry execution.

**Test method:** Fabric importer/broker/grant tests plus actual supported provider checks.

### [SVC-010] Runtime secret isolation and rotation

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Strict credential reads and durable native outbox/key lifecycle improve local persistence and diagnostics. Privacy consent ledger defaults deny; no general hosted secret-isolation service or comprehensive rotation receipt is established.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Test per-tenant encryption/key isolation, revoked credential denial, key rotation and backup restore with live local/hosted consumers. Maintain private files, no secret argv/log/env propagation to unapproved workers.

**Status:** Observed process-global last-known secret fragment behavior; tenancy/rotation verification required. **Targets:** A/B: local owner scopes; C: eliminate cross-tenant global fragments.

Runtime refresh has a process-global generation counter and keeps previous fragment after unexpected failure. Bind fragments to execution/account context and define fail-closed behavior for revoked required secrets.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/secrets/runtime.ts:4–9](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/secrets/runtime.ts#L4-L9); [packages/shared/src/secrets/runtime.ts:23–49](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/secrets/runtime.ts#L23-L49); [packages/server-core/src/sessions/spawn-env.ts:1–42](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/sessions/spawn-env.ts#L1-L42).

**Requirements:** Only declared and authorized secret refs enter a child's environment; revoked values are removed.

**DoD:** Concurrent tenant spawns cannot inherit another tenant's env fragment.

**Full functional verification:** Rotate/remove secrets, force provider failure and race two tenants' spawns; inspect only redacted env metadata.

**Test method:** Secret chain/runtime/spawn-env tests with sentinel secret values.

#### [SVC-010.1] Scope spawn environment per execution owner

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Requirements:** No implicit process-global secret reuse across accounts.

**DoD:** Every child receives only its authorized refs.

**Full functional verification:** Race different tenants and compare allowlisted environment keys.

**Test method:** Concurrency tests against real subprocesses with redacted assertions.

#### [SVC-010.2] Rotation, revocation and redaction boundaries

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

Decide which failures block spawn and clear stale revoked values; register secrets before logs/errors/output paths. **Targets:** A/B: local owner scopes; C: eliminate cross-tenant global fragments.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/secrets/runtime.ts:4–9](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/secrets/runtime.ts#L4-L9); [packages/shared/src/secrets/runtime.ts:23–49](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/secrets/runtime.ts#L23-L49); [packages/server-core/src/sessions/spawn-env.ts:1–42](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/sessions/spawn-env.ts#L1-L42).

**Requirements:** Errors never contain secrets or retain revoked credentials.

**DoD:** Rotation changes future calls and revoked required credentials stop execution.

**Full functional verification:** Rotate while sessions are active, fail resolution and scan stored logs/artifacts.

**Test method:** Secret availability/redaction tests and operational rotation drill.

### [SVC-011] OAuth redirects, callback ownership and hosted provider setup

**Reconciled implementation:** verification_still_required — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Candidate/source and built auth tests establish configured shared-password HTTP/WS behavior, not third-party OAuth consent, refresh, redirect ownership or account provisioning.

**Status:** Existing flows; hosted callback/replay certification required. **Targets:** A/B: loopback/external browser; C: public HTTPS server callbacks.

Hosted HTTP callback deliberately skips client/workspace caller checks and relies on OAuth state. Certify one-time state, expiry, initiating owner, redirect allowlists and credential placement. Generic OAuth CLI flow is explicitly unsupported.

**Code references:** [packages/server-core/src/webui/http-server.ts:317–355](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/webui/http-server.ts#L317-L355); [packages/shared/src/auth/oauth-flow-store.ts:1–70](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/auth/oauth-flow-store.ts#L1-L70); [packages/shared/src/sources/credential-manager.ts:1160–1172](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/sources/credential-manager.ts#L1160-L1172).

**Requirements:** PKCE/state validation, public redirect registration, owner binding and cancellation across supported providers.

**DoD:** OAuth completion connects only the initiating owner's source and refreshes its credentials.

**Full functional verification:** Authenticate Google/Microsoft/MCP/LLM/ROX flows, replay callbacks and submit another user's state.

**Test method:** OAuth store/callback/relay suites plus live provider authorization acceptance.

#### [SVC-011.1] Bind and consume callback state once

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Requirements:** State has expiry, initiating owner and one-time completion semantics.

**DoD:** Expired/replayed/mismatched callbacks deny safely.

**Full functional verification:** Send the same callback concurrently and after expiry; switch user before return.

**Test method:** HTTP callback adversarial state tests.

**Code references:** [packages/server-core/src/webui/http-server.ts:317–355](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/webui/http-server.ts#L317-L355); [packages/shared/src/auth/oauth-flow-store.ts:1–70](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/auth/oauth-flow-store.ts#L1-L70); [packages/shared/src/sources/credential-manager.ts:1160–1172](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/sources/credential-manager.ts#L1160-L1172).

**Requirements:** No embedded production client secret in distributed apps.

**DoD:** All offered auth actions finish or recover from user cancellation.

**Full functional verification:** Perform fresh consent, denial, timeout and token renewal from each target client.

**Test method:** Real OAuth provider matrix and relay contract tests.

### [SVC-012] Daytona cloud execution truthfulness and process results

**Reconciled implementation:** observed_gap_retained — source_inspected_or_compiler_only.

**Observed branch progress:** No cloud-runner source delta repairs ignored exec exitCode followed by done in the Daytona pump. Candidate compiler success does not make execution results truthful.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Persist stdout/stderr/exitCode and classify failure/cancel/timeout correctly; execute a successful and failing real Daytona job and verify server event, UI, artifact and receipt agree.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts#L325-L355); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-client.ts#L305-L316); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts#L71-L78)


**Status:** Observed nonzero exec result ignored; release blocker. **Targets:** A/B/C: same server/provider outcome semantics.

The runner awaits client.exec but ignores exitCode/stdout/stderr before setting state='done'. Detect unsuccessful exits and incomplete subtask artifacts; record actual progress/usage rather than unconditional 1/1.

**Code references:** [packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts:325–355](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts#L325-L355); [packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-client.ts:305–316](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-client.ts#L305-L316); [packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts:71–78](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts#L71-L78).

**Requirements:** Success requires successful runner exit plus validated outputs and subtask outcomes; budgets enforced using measured usage.

**DoD:** Failing runner cannot be presented as completed research; usage and failure reason persist.

**Full functional verification:** Run success, nonzero exit, missing rox-run, partial artifact, oversized output and token-limit cases.

**Test method:** Daytona provider/conformance tests with result-bearing client fixtures and live sandbox run.

#### [SVC-012.1] Honor exit status and validate completion artifacts

Capture exec result, distinguish tool/process failure, read per-subtask completion markers and reject incomplete output. **Targets:** A/B/C: same server/provider outcome semantics.

**Code references:** [packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts:325–355](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts#L325-L355); [packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-client.ts:305–316](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-client.ts#L305-L316); [packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts:71–78](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts#L71-L78).

**Requirements:** Nonzero exit and missing completion signal fail the run.

**DoD:** Failure state and actionable diagnostic survive restart.

**Full functional verification:** Make rox-run exit 17 after creating one artifact and inspect status/UI.

**Test method:** Provider regression test plus controlled sandbox executable.

#### [SVC-012.2] Measure progress and enforce token/cost budgets

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** No cloud-runner source delta repairs ignored exec exitCode followed by done in the Daytona pump. Candidate compiler success does not make execution results truthful.

Collect runner usage/progress records and enforce maxLlmTokens in the live runner/control path. **Targets:** A/B/C: same server/provider outcome semantics.

**Code references:** [packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts:325–355](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts#L325-L355); [packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-client.ts:305–316](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-client.ts#L305-L316); [packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts:71–78](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-provider.ts#L71-L78).

**Requirements:** Accounting uses actual tokens and runtime; exceeded limits terminate.

**DoD:** No success reported with absent usage or unfinished subtasks.

**Full functional verification:** Execute multiple subtasks near token/wall/artifact limits.

**Test method:** Usage/budget boundary tests plus billed provider reconciliation.

### [SVC-013] Daytona paid gate, hardened image and control plane integration

**Reconciled implementation:** observed_gap_retained — source_inspected_or_compiler_only.

**Observed branch progress:** Paid-provision gate/config and direct provider construction are unchanged. The audit records an enforcement verification requirement, not an established exploit or successful paid provisioning.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Trace and enforce the paid gate at every provisioning boundary; validate image pin/digest, sandbox egress, credentials and control-plane ownership using explicit authorized accounts and cost limits.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-sandbox.ts#L2-L13); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-sandbox.ts#L72-L104); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/handlers/rpc/cloud-runs.ts#L254-L267); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-client.ts#L235-L254)


**Status:** Observed gate helper separate from live provider; release blocker pending enforcement proof. **Targets:** A/B: cloud controls available on desktop; C: account-owned sandbox service.

Paid provisioning is disabled by DAYTONA_PAID_PROVISION_ENABLED=false, but the live RPC provider factory directly constructs DaytonaProvider. Trace every provision path and enforce gate/entitlement/budget on the real path. Verify actual REST contract and hardened snapshot includes rox-run and its dependencies.

**Code references:** [packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-sandbox.ts:2–13](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-sandbox.ts#L2-L13); [packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-sandbox.ts:72–104](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-sandbox.ts#L72-L104); [packages/server-core/src/handlers/rpc/cloud-runs.ts:254–267](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/handlers/rpc/cloud-runs.ts#L254-L267); [packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-client.ts:235–254](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/daytona-client.ts#L235-L254).

**Requirements:** One authoritative provision policy; no retired-provider fallback or unapproved cloud spend.

**DoD:** Unpaid/gated/kill-switch calls cannot create a sandbox; enabled paid calls run only approved images.

**Full functional verification:** Attempt each RPC/schedule/workflow entry with gate closed and inspect provider create requests.

**Test method:** Provision policy/RPC tests plus sandbox image and provider API contract acceptance.

**Requirements:** Gate cannot be bypassed through direct factory calls or alternate routes.

**DoD:** All denied paths issue zero sandbox-create requests.

**Full functional verification:** Call every provision entry as unpaid, over-budget and gated accounts.

**Test method:** RPC-to-provider spy tests plus controlled remote request audit.

**Full functional verification:** Provision, upload spec, execute, download, cancel/delete in actual provider staging.

**Test method:** Live Daytona contract test and image executable smoke.

### [SVC-014] Cloud run durability, restart recovery and local execution

**Reconciled implementation:** observed_gap_retained — source_inspected_or_compiler_only.

**Observed branch progress:** Cloud-runner implementation remains unchanged; native Notes journal/replica persistence is a separate subsystem. Local reference stub still simulates output rather than executing requested workload.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Implement/choose real local executor, explicit stub visibility and durable cloud state recovery; exercise crash/resume/cancel/artifact retrieval and stale sandbox reconciliation.

**Status:** Observed local provider defaults to reference stub; single-file registry readiness gap. **Targets:** A: Windows child-tree ownership; B: POSIX process groups; C: durable hosted run ownership.

Replace reference output in user-facing local runs with a real agent runner, or clearly remove this mode from final execution claims. Harden registry/schedule persistence and reconcile running sandboxes after server restart.

**Requirements:** Durable run owner, spec, events, outputs and terminal result; no orphan work after cancellation.

**DoD:** Restart restores active/terminal runs; local mode performs the requested task.

**Full functional verification:** Submit, kill host mid-run, restart, resume, cancel and inspect artifacts/process/sandbox inventory.

**Test method:** Cloud runner conformance/RPC tests plus host crash-recovery matrix.

**Requirements:** Identical run contract with real inference/tool behavior.

**DoD:** Cancel leaves no child or grandchild process running.

**Full functional verification:** Spawn a nested long-running command in local run and cancel on each OS.

**Test method:** Local provider lifecycle tests plus Windows process enumeration acceptance.

#### [SVC-014.2] Persist registries and recover distributed runs

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Cloud-runner implementation remains unchanged; native Notes journal/replica persistence is a separate subsystem. Local reference stub still simulates output rather than executing requested workload.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate and verify the original subtask outcome for 'Persist registries and recover distributed runs', reusing the parent source changes.

**Requirements:** Run/schedule writes tolerate concurrent operations and partial file writes.

**DoD:** Restart neither loses runs nor repeats completed work.

**Full functional verification:** Interrupt writes/pump and restart from persisted run records.

**Test method:** Filesystem fault injection and provider reconcile tests.

### [SVC-015] Retired Cloudflare gateway disposition and API hardening

**Reconciled implementation:** observed_gap_retained — source_inspected_or_compiler_only.

**Observed branch progress:** Retired Cloudflare code is unchanged and not the active default provider. Snapshot comparison provides no new credential/auth/deployment acceptance for this legacy surface.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Decide supported legacy status; remove/disable unreachable production entry points or protect/authenticate and test them. Preserve documentation that Daytona/local/native is the current provider registry.

**Status:** Observed retained v1 shared-token gateway; conditional if retained/deployed. **Targets:** A/B/C: no hidden fallback; C: isolate or retire legacy service.

Cloudflare remains exported/deployable although public registry retires it. Decide whether it is an internal legacy target or removed service. If retained, replace shared-token run IDs with authorized tenant ownership and robust RunSpec schemas/quotas.

**Code references:** [packages/cloud-runner/src/public-registry.ts:2–21](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/public-registry.ts#L2-L21); [apps/cloud-gateway/src/index.ts:11–37](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/apps/cloud-gateway/src/index.ts#L11-L37); [apps/cloud-gateway/src/index.ts:77–96](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/apps/cloud-gateway/src/index.ts#L77-L96); [apps/cloud-gateway/wrangler.jsonc:7–34](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/apps/cloud-gateway/wrangler.jsonc#L7-L34).

**Requirements:** Supported provider list matches runtime/routes/docs; legacy endpoint cannot broaden access or bypass spend policy.

**DoD:** No normal user path silently uses Cloudflare; retained APIs validate ownership and size limits.

**Full functional verification:** Try legacy configuration, known foreign run IDs, parent fork IDs and malformed/oversized request bodies.

**Test method:** Registry migration tests plus gateway API/security harness when service retained.

#### [SVC-015.1] Retire or constrain gateway deployment

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Retired Cloudflare code is unchanged and not the active default provider. Snapshot comparison provides no new credential/auth/deployment acceptance for this legacy surface.

**Requirements:** Provider retirement enforced independently of UI visibility.

**DoD:** Old configs migrate predictably without invoking retired provider.

**Full functional verification:** Load old cloudflare config and submit from every execution entry.

**Test method:** Public registry/coercion and RPC migration tests.

#### [SVC-015.2] Tenant-safe run IDs, schemas and share revocation

**Requirements:** No shared administrative token in distributed clients.

**DoD:** Foreign IDs and invalid specs reject; revoked share becomes unreadable.

**Full functional verification:** Two owners exchange IDs, malformed schemas and share tokens.

**Test method:** Worker/DO integration tests and deployed gateway adversarial API test.

### [SVC-016] Messaging gateway ownership, routing and operational lifecycle

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Messaging capability contract explicitly says five adapters support live receive/send but no history import. RPC routing changed; current independent candidate typecheck still fails messaging-gateway, so broad all-package readiness is false.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Repair remaining gateway compiler errors, prove one owner/runtime per account and isolate binding/source/credential scope. Add durable routing/dedupe/backpressure and live adapter evidence; do not promise history import from live-only adapters.

**Status:** Existing owner/public-inbox policy; production delivery verification required. **Targets:** A/B: local gateway ownership; C: server-hosted adapters and credential stores.

Certify all configured platforms through the same bootstrap, workspace binding, command access evaluator and session event fanout. Keep public-inbox non-executing and require authoritative owners for tool routing and permission buttons.

**Code references:** [packages/messaging-gateway/src/bootstrap.ts:28–70](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/messaging-gateway/src/bootstrap.ts#L28-L70); [packages/messaging-gateway/src/access-control.ts:55–110](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/messaging-gateway/src/access-control.ts#L55-L110); [packages/messaging-gateway/src/router.ts:1–90](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/messaging-gateway/src/router.ts#L1-L90).

**Requirements:** Sender/workspace/session identity and access mode enforced before commands, turns and decisions.

**DoD:** Unauthorized messages cannot start sessions or approve tools; authorized responses reliably reach the correct thread.

**Full functional verification:** Pair an owner and outsider on each platform; send commands, attachments and permission buttons across two workspaces.

**Test method:** Messaging access/router/commands/button/registry suites plus real platform acceptance.

**Requirements:** Gateway health reports unavailable platform and pending delivery states.

**DoD:** Restart recovers bindings without duplicate agent turns.

**Full functional verification:** Kill/restart gateway while inbound/outbound messages and attachments are active.

**Test method:** Fault-injection gateway lifecycle tests plus adapter reconnect drill.

### [SVC-017] Telegram polling, forum topics and attachments

**Reconciled implementation:** verification_still_required — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Capability declaration clarifies Telegram live-only behavior; no new adapter-specific source change was found in the reviewed candidate relevant to original polling/media/history gaps.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Execute real Telegram account/bot flow, forum threads, attachments, polling restart/dedupe and per-workspace binding revoke. Implement history import only if product requirements require it, with separate API/custody design.

**Full functional verification:** Upload resource, use approval card, send unknown event and large file.

**Test method:** Card/resource tests and actual Lark UI readback.

### [SVC-021] WeChat/iLink authentication, encrypted media and polling

**Reconciled implementation:** verification_still_required — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** WeChat live-only capability is explicit; no new real authentication/encrypted media/polling proof is inferred.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Run actual authorized iLink login, expiration/reconnect, media upload/download and poll dedupe; contain keys and prove logout removes usable authentication without corrupting unrelated accounts.

**Status:** Implemented vendored protocol adapter; live compatibility certification required. **Targets:** A/B/C: account-isolated state/sync buffers and supported media runtime.

Certify QR login, account selection/session guards, polling sync buffer, encrypted CDN media, upload/decrypt, audio transcoding and reconnect. These external protocol assumptions need live account tests; transport code alone does not establish current service compatibility.

**Code references:** [packages/messaging-gateway/src/adapters/wechat/index.ts:1–85](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/messaging-gateway/src/adapters/wechat/index.ts#L1-L85); [packages/messaging-gateway/src/adapters/wechat/ilink/auth/login-qr.ts:1–65](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/messaging-gateway/src/adapters/wechat/ilink/auth/login-qr.ts#L1-L65); [packages/messaging-gateway/src/adapters/wechat/ilink/media/media-download.ts:1–45](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/messaging-gateway/src/adapters/wechat/ilink/media/media-download.ts#L1-L45).

**Requirements:** Protocol endpoint/configuration and supported media dependencies pinned; auth state tenant-isolated.

**DoD:** Real account pairs, sends/receives supported content and recovers polling state after restart.

**Full functional verification:** Pair dedicated account, exchange text/image/audio/file, restart and test expired session/invalid ciphertext.

**Test method:** WeChat adapter/send/renderer tests plus real test account protocol acceptance.

#### [SVC-021.1] Auth and polling state recovery

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** WeChat live-only capability is explicit; no new real authentication/encrypted media/polling proof is inferred.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset.

**Requirements:** Account/session mismatch denies before processing.

**DoD:** Restart resumes one owned poller with accurate online state.

**Full functional verification:** Switch accounts, corrupt buffer and expire login during incoming traffic.

**Test method:** Account/session-guard/polling integration and live reconnect.

#### [SVC-021.2] Encrypted media and transcoder deployment

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** WeChat live-only capability is explicit; no new real authentication/encrypted media/polling proof is inferred.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate and verify the original subtask outcome for 'Encrypted media and transcoder deployment', reusing the parent source changes.

Verify AES/CDN URL handling, MIME/size limits, failed decryption and Silk transcoder availability per host. **Targets:** A/B/C: account-isolated state/sync buffers and supported media runtime.

**Code references:** [packages/messaging-gateway/src/adapters/wechat/index.ts:1–85](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/messaging-gateway/src/adapters/wechat/index.ts#L1-L85); [packages/messaging-gateway/src/adapters/wechat/ilink/auth/login-qr.ts:1–65](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/messaging-gateway/src/adapters/wechat/ilink/auth/login-qr.ts#L1-L65); [packages/messaging-gateway/src/adapters/wechat/ilink/media/media-download.ts:1–45](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/messaging-gateway/src/adapters/wechat/ilink/media/media-download.ts#L1-L45).

**Requirements:** No unrestricted download or leaked temporary media.

**DoD:** Supported media round trips or gives actionable unavailable errors.

**Full functional verification:** Send encrypted sample content and invalid/oversized media on each host.

**Test method:** Media crypto/download tests plus real audio/image delivery.

### [SVC-022] Automations execution, retries and side-effect semantics

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Retry state now persists inflight before external HTTP effects, records terminal_pending before queue removal and resolves restarted ambiguous inflight as unknown outcome instead of automatic duplicate resend. This supersedes a blanket claim of simple unsafe retry; webhook/history tests and process-loss receipts exist.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset.

**Status:** Observed single-process retry invariant; multi-worker readiness gap. **Targets:** A/B: one workspace executor; C: leases/queue ownership for hosted workers.

Certify prompts, webhooks, scripts, knowledge and meeting-followup actions. RetryScheduler explicitly supports one process and at-least-once effects after restart; hosted deployment must honor that invariant or introduce leases/idempotency/DLQ.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/automations/retry-scheduler.ts:2–25](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/automations/retry-scheduler.ts#L2-L25); [packages/shared/src/automations/script-executor.ts:4–15](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/automations/script-executor.ts#L4-L15); [packages/shared/src/automations/automation-system.ts:1–70](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/automations/automation-system.ts#L1-L70).

**Requirements:** Event/action permissions, retry/idempotency semantics and secret environment boundaries documented and enforced.

**DoD:** Automation outcomes persist accurately and do not falsely claim external success.

**Full functional verification:** Trigger each action, restart between effect and ack, test duplicated events and trap script termination.

**Test method:** Automation/security/retry/script/handler suites plus real fixture side-effect services.

#### [SVC-022.1] Hosted lease ownership and webhook idempotency

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Retry state now persists inflight before external HTTP effects, records terminal_pending before queue removal and resolves restarted ambiguous inflight as unknown outcome instead of automatic duplicate resend. This supersedes a blanket claim of simple unsafe retry; webhook/history tests and process-loss receipts exist.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate and verify the original subtask outcome for 'Hosted lease ownership and webhook idempotency', reusing the parent source changes. Complete only the requirements not already implemented, then execute the full acceptance below. Integrate revised semantics and give users repair/reconciliation actions for unknown outcomes.

Keep one executor per workspace or add durable leases and side-effect idempotency keys; retain failed deliveries for inspection/retry. **Targets:** A/B: one workspace executor; C: leases/queue ownership for hosted workers.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/automations/retry-scheduler.ts:2–25](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/automations/retry-scheduler.ts#L2-L25); [packages/shared/src/automations/script-executor.ts:4–15](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/automations/script-executor.ts#L4-L15); [packages/shared/src/automations/automation-system.ts:1–70](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/automations/automation-system.ts#L1-L70).

**Requirements:** Two replicas cannot concurrently own one queue; restart duplication handled.

**DoD:** Failed/uncertain delivery is visible and recoverable.

**Full functional verification:** Run two workers and crash one immediately after webhook accepts.

**Test method:** Retry crash/lease tests with effect-recording HTTP fixture.

#### [SVC-022.2] Script runtime, policy and descendant cleanup

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Retry state now persists inflight before external HTTP effects, records terminal_pending before queue removal and resolves restarted ambiguous inflight as unknown outcome instead of automatic duplicate resend.

Resolve bundled Bun/Node/Python runtime; enforce workspace containment, environment allowlist and Windows/POSIX descendant termination. **Targets:** A/B: one workspace executor; C: leases/queue ownership for hosted workers.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/automations/retry-scheduler.ts:2–25](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/automations/retry-scheduler.ts#L2-L25); [packages/shared/src/automations/script-executor.ts:4–15](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/automations/script-executor.ts#L4-L15); [packages/shared/src/automations/automation-system.ts:1–70](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/automations/automation-system.ts#L1-L70).

**Requirements:** Unapproved script cannot escape source/workspace grants.

**DoD:** Timeout/cancel leaves no descendants; logs do not contain secrets.

**Full functional verification:** Execute path traversal/symlink/trapped-signal and nested-child scripts.

**Test method:** Script/security tests and OS-specific process cleanup acceptance.

### [SVC-023] Scheduler, task runner and workflow receipts

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Durable occurrence ledger records workspace/matcher/revision/UTC/timezone/action identity with SQLite atomic claim; IANA/DST matching uses supplied instant. Personal task persistence and process-loss tests are added. Workflow publication placeholder remains a separate unfinished path.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Validate end-to-end schedule/task/workflow receipts, DST cases, restart and multiple owners; finish placeholder publication and provide cancellation/retry reconciliation. Verify task source authority through native/service boundaries.

**Status:** Existing executors; durable hosted coordination and receipt verification required. **Targets:** A/B: sleep/wake and local-time behavior; C: leader/lease and timezone policy.

Certify cron/interval matching, timezone/DST, missed ticks, task resume, graph validation, live workflow receipts and permission routing. Workflow production success explicitly requires caller-injected receipts and non-loopback evidence.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/scheduler/scheduler-service.ts:1–85](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/scheduler/scheduler-service.ts#L1-L85); [packages/server-core/src/tasks/TaskRunner.ts:843–903](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/tasks/TaskRunner.ts#L843-L903); [packages/server-core/src/workflows/executor.ts:36–54](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/workflows/executor.ts#L36-L54).

**Requirements:** Durable schedule/task/workflow ownership; defined misfire policy; receipts tied to real external operations.

**DoD:** Restart/resume never fabricates completed nodes or repeats non-idempotent work silently.

**Full functional verification:** Run a multi-node workflow with failure/approval, suspend machine, change timezone and resume after restart.

**Test method:** Scheduler/cron/TaskRunner/workflow live-executor suites plus durable service integration.

### [SVC-024] Knowledge bridge, managed SiYuan/OEM kernel and local vaults

**Reconciled implementation:** verification_still_required — source_inspected_or_compiler_only.

**Observed branch progress:** General native domain authority and handler type repairs do not establish managed SiYuan process supervision, binary delivery or vault/OEM lifecycle completion. Existing selected G2 Variant C progress remains valid.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Complete packaged kernel binaries, consent, port ownership, filesystem containment, upgrade/backup/restore and actual vault synchronization on Windows/macOS; define hosted vault boundaries and test UI-to-service round trips.

**Requirements:** Only approved pinned kernel runs; server/desktop vault ownership is explicit; no unintended browser access to local desktop files.

**DoD:** Connect/read/search/propose/review/apply/rollback and export work against actual provider data.

**Full functional verification:** Use a real external provider and approved managed build, edit out-of-band, apply stale proposal and restart watcher/kernel.

**Requirements:** Blocked gate remains enforced until evidence is accepted.

**DoD:** Approved build starts; absent/invalid pin or conflicting workspace fails safely.

**Full functional verification:** Install fresh kernel, test lock conflict, health timeout and crash recovery.

**Test method:** Provider gate/process-manager tests plus packaged kernel acceptance.

#### [SVC-024.2] Mutation safety, watches and substantive publication

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** General native domain authority and handler type repairs do not establish managed SiYuan process supervision, binary delivery or vault/OEM lifecycle completion. Existing selected G2 Variant C progress remains valid.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate and verify the original subtask outcome for 'Mutation safety, watches and substantive publication', reusing the parent source changes. Complete only the requirements not already implemented, then execute the full acceptance below.

**Requirements:** Review approval precedes writes; full content and stable links persist.

**DoD:** Readback matches approved draft and rollback restores prior content.

**Full functional verification:** Publish session/run, modify provider externally, apply stale draft and undo.

**Test method:** Bridge/publication/watcher tests plus live vault/provider comparison.

### [SVC-025] Memory storage, search, learning and scope parity

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Lessons now carry immutable issuer/subject ownership, filter prompt context/list/updates/archive/recovery by owner and add native permission-scoped RPC. This is real scope work. memory/fts-index.ts still imports Bun SQLite, unaffected by the generic adapter introduced for six other consumers.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Complete memory search parity under actual Electron Node and hosted Bun, migrate/index/rebuild safely, validate graph/dedup/archive/lesson injection per owner and denial after membership revoke. Keep unavailable FTS distinct from successful general SQLite tests.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/memory/fts-index.ts#L14-L41); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/memory/MemoryService.ts#L1-L75); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/memory/MemoryProposalStore.ts#L1-L65); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/memory/LessonStore.ts#L145-L215); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/memory/MemoryService.ts#L1-L90); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/memory/fts-index.ts#L20-L50)


**Status:** Observed desktop Electron FTS fallback; search capability gap. **Targets:** A/B: Electron Node disables bun:sqlite FTS; C: Bun server has FTS.

FTS index loads bun:sqlite lazily and explicitly falls back to recency in Electron/Node. Define equivalent supported search quality across desktop and hosted clients; certify lesson approval, provenance, scope disabling, decay and rebuild.

**Requirements:** Scope boundaries and search availability visible; authoritative markdown/JSONL is recoverable independently of indexes.

**DoD:** Approved lessons influence only authorized sessions; revoked/deleted lessons stop being retrieved.

**Full functional verification:** Create global/workspace/session lessons, search distinctive older text, disable memory and rebuild corrupted index.

**Test method:** Memory service/provenance/decay/FTS suites plus desktop and server retrieval acceptance.

See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate and verify the original subtask outcome for 'JMAP capabilities, external delivery and device revocation', reusing the parent source changes. Complete only the requirements not already implemented, then execute the full acceptance below. Run real Stalwart provisioning from trusted signup event, delivery/sent receipt, thread/move/delete/draft/send/attachment/SSE and expired credential repair. Confirm hosted tenants cannot supply foreign mailbox owner or admin credential.

Verify session account identity, paging, attachments, send failures, SMTP/DNS configuration, app-password revoke and retention. **Targets:** A/B: device-scoped mailbox credential; C: trusted signup/provisioning worker.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/mail/provisioning.ts:2–18](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/mail/provisioning.ts#L2-L18); [packages/shared/src/mail/provisioning.ts:46–72](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/mail/provisioning.ts#L46-L72); [packages/shared/src/mail/jmap-client.ts:1–75](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/mail/jmap-client.ts#L1-L75).

**Requirements:** Mailbox access scoped per device/account with operator diagnostics.

**DoD:** External recipient receives sent message and revoked device loses access.

**Full functional verification:** Send attachment both directions, revoke one device and retry.

**Test method:** JMAP contract tests plus external inbox delivery readback.

### [SVC-027] Encrypted account replica and cross-device synchronization

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Encrypted durable SQLite outbox stores authenticated payload envelopes, immutable enqueue identity, trusted journal ACKs and scoped snapshots; key zeroization and filesystem checks exist. Replica maps remain local views, and server Notes sync is the implemented domain. Original 'in-memory only' summary is superseded for the outbox.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate durable producer/outbox/ACK authority without a second writer; prove offline/restart/device revoked/replay/conflict/rotation/restore using actual two devices. Extend each required replicated domain explicitly; do not claim universal account sync from Notes-only producer.

**Requirements:** Encrypted durable per-account operations; excluded categories and explicit sync controls honored.

**DoD:** Two enrolled devices and browser can synchronize eligible content across restart without leaking excluded data.

**Full functional verification:** Edit offline on both devices, reconnect, resolve markdown conflict, revoke device and execute account deletion.

**Test method:** Replica crypto/tenancy tests plus two-device transport/restart acceptance.

**Requirements:** Membership managed by trusted server authority.

**DoD:** Restart preserves encrypted replica and unauthorized workspace denies.

**Full functional verification:** Restart sync service then request another account's op cursor.

**Test method:** Replica API/database fault and tenancy integration tests.

**DoD:** Conflicts are reviewable and revoked devices cannot upload/download.

**Full functional verification:** Lose a device, recover on new device and verify deletion on all peers.

**Test method:** Multi-device chaos and cryptographic recovery/deletion tests.

### [SVC-028] Organizations, team outbox and remote collaboration

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Org actions now derive actor from principal.subject and native authorization; self-profile is owner-scoped. Team queue distinguishes accepted/delivered IDs, but LocalOnly transport still accepts none and pulls null; no remote organization delivery backend is established.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Requirements:** Authenticated org roles, targeted invites, shared comments/assignments/handoffs/access/approvals/activity and durable cursors.

**DoD:** Two users on different devices see synchronized authorized state and revocation removes access.

**Full functional verification:** Invite second user remotely, comment/assign/handoff offline, reconnect and revoke their membership.

**Test method:** Org/team store tests plus multi-user server transport acceptance.

**Requirements:** Renderer/local profile cannot select arbitrary member identity.

**DoD:** Only intended user can redeem invite and roles enforce permissions.

**Full functional verification:** Try wrong account, expired token, duplicate redemption and last-owner removal.

**Test method:** Organization API invite/RBAC adversarial tests.

Add real TeamSyncAdapter push/pull with idempotent entry IDs, cursors, merge policy and visibility-scoped events. **Targets:** A/B: local team data migration; C: authoritative organization service.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/team/sync.ts:4–10](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/team/sync.ts#L4-L10); [packages/shared/src/team/sync.ts:37–58](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/team/sync.ts#L37-L58); [packages/shared/src/orgs/storage.ts:340–367](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/orgs/storage.ts#L340-L367).

**Requirements:** Accepted entries are acknowledged only after durable server write.

**DoD:** Offline entries sync once and conflicts remain visible.

**Full functional verification:** Edit same task/comment on two users; drop/replay network responses.

### [SVC-029] Session collaboration links, presence and public publication gates

**Reconciled implementation:** verification_still_required — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Canonical Notes shared sync and scoped authorizations are new; they do not enable general session public publication. Existing DG03 publication/presence gates require their own acceptance.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Status:** Observed local invite service and disabled public publication helper. **Targets:** A/B: account authenticated client; C: actual bro/share service.

Certify a real cross-device bro.rox.one join route, presence, editor/viewer ACLs, conflict resolution and revocation. Public publication is explicitly DG03_GATED; retain gate until retention, abuse and deletion SLA are fulfilled across every share mechanism.

**Requirements:** Collaboration requires membership; public sharing has approved visibility, expiry, redaction and deletion semantics.

**DoD:** Remote invited user joins only intended session; revoked access and deleted publication cease immediately.

**Full functional verification:** Open invite on another account/device, edit simultaneously, revoke and test an old public/share URL.

**Test method:** Invite/presence/conflict/publication tests plus actual hosted routes and readback.

#### [SVC-029.1] Hosted join/presence/permission enforcement

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Canonical Notes shared sync and scoped authorizations are new; they do not enable general session public publication. Existing DG03 publication/presence gates require their own acceptance.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Full functional verification:** Publish allowed test content, revoke and inspect CDN/object/API access.

**Test method:** Share route integration with retention/deletion and secret-sentinel tests.

### [SVC-030] Marketplace catalog, signed packages and installation lifecycle

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Catalog/installer now document SHA256 plus Ed25519 remote catalog authenticity, pinned SHA clone verification, atomic staged install, collision/local-edit preservation and clone-only upstream handling. Tool entries remain deferred to toolchain update.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

### [SVC-031] Projects, resource bundles and portable workspace data

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Projects/OKR/roadmap AI RPCs and scope projection are implemented with native action metadata, current permission/fence rechecks and real server model generation. Portable config/path handling improves workspace data; no live provider/native DOM receipt closes service.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Requirements:** Project path containment, quotas and grants; bundles exclude secrets and reset auth correctly.

**DoD:** Portable export/import preserves valid content while clearing runtime credentials and refreshing watchers.

**Full functional verification:** Create project/assets, move/export to another platform, import conflicting resources and verify source reconnect.

**Test method:** Project/resource/bundle path tests plus real cross-platform round trip.

Validate slugs, absolute/relative root mapping, symlink/case collisions, non-ASCII names and deletion scope. **Targets:** A: Windows paths/ACLs; B: macOS paths; C: server workspace upload/download.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/projects/storage.ts:2–8](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/projects/storage.ts#L2-L8); [packages/shared/src/projects/storage.ts:39–57](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/projects/storage.ts#L39-L57); [packages/shared/src/resources/resource-bundle.ts:4–13](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/resources/resource-bundle.ts#L4-L13).

**Requirements:** No crafted project/asset path escapes workspace.

**DoD:** Assets/context persist and delete affects only selected project.

**Full functional verification:** Use traversal, drive/UNC paths and symlink targets; restart after changes.

**Test method:** Project storage path/migration tests and native filesystem acceptance.

#### [SVC-031.2] Bundle staging, redaction and overwrite recovery

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Projects/OKR/roadmap AI RPCs and scope projection are implemented with native action metadata, current permission/fence rechecks and real server model generation. Portable config/path handling improves workspace data; no live provider/native DOM receipt closes service.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate and verify the original subtask outcome for 'Bundle staging, redaction and overwrite recovery', reusing the parent source changes. Complete only the requirements not already implemented, then execute the full acceptance below. Validate real model response/proposal approval and project/resource CRUD/import/export with source authority, conflicts and cancellation. Test relocation between Windows/macOS/hosted workspace roots without absolute secret/source paths.

Verify import staging/rename, watcher notification, source credential deletion and automation retry/history reset with explicit overwrite behavior. **Targets:** A: Windows paths/ACLs; B: macOS paths; C: server workspace upload/download.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/projects/storage.ts:2–8](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/projects/storage.ts#L2-L8); [packages/shared/src/projects/storage.ts:39–57](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/projects/storage.ts#L39-L57); [packages/shared/src/resources/resource-bundle.ts:4–13](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/resources/resource-bundle.ts#L4-L13).

**Requirements:** Bundle/file caps and secret stripping apply to every file/type.

**DoD:** Interrupted import leaves recoverable state and no secret-bearing export.

**Full functional verification:** Export sentinel credentials, import over active resources and interrupt rename.

**Test method:** Resource import/export and filesystem failure-injection tests.

### [SVC-032] Pages, custom views and mediated source actions

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Pages backend and canonical content handlers changed; exact010 browser creation writes real private page.json and survives same-profile restart. Native docs descriptor/block-tree/markdown commit service adds a separate canonical document pipeline.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Complete custom views/action permissions and all source backends; verify unauthorized read/write, source revocation and cross-workspace paths. Browser Pages persistence is bounded to one private profile, not cross-device hosted document sync.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/pages/action-bridge.ts#L4-L28); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/pages/action-bridge.ts#L55-L75); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/views/evaluator.ts#L1-L65); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/handlers/rpc/pages.ts#L1-L90); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/docs/markdown-commit.ts#L1-L90)


**Status:** Existing lease/grant broker; cross-runtime production wiring verification required. **Targets:** A/B: desktop page host; C: sandboxed browser page/server broker.

Certify page persistence/data refresh/publishing, view evaluation and source actions through content-bound leases/grants. Generated page JavaScript must not directly access sources, secrets, host filesystem or unscoped server RPC.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/pages/action-bridge.ts:4–28](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/pages/action-bridge.ts#L4-L28); [packages/shared/src/pages/action-bridge.ts:55–75](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/pages/action-bridge.ts#L55-L75); [packages/shared/src/views/evaluator.ts:1–65](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/views/evaluator.ts#L1-L65).

**Requirements:** Sandbox, owner/frame binding, schema/timeout/rate/replay limits and approved source policies enforced.

**DoD:** Page read/action/refresh works; stale digest, nonce, replay and foreign workspace requests reject.

**Full functional verification:** Create an interactive page with API/MCP/script action, edit its content, reuse old grant and exercise from hosted browser.

**Test method:** Page action/data/share/view evaluator suites plus actual iframe/browser integration.

#### [SVC-032.1] Page broker execution and frame ownership

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

Bind lease/action requests to authenticated owner and real renderer frame, and validate source grants after lease/grant matching. **Targets:** A/B: desktop page host; C: sandboxed browser page/server broker.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/pages/action-bridge.ts:4–28](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/pages/action-bridge.ts#L4-L28); [packages/shared/src/pages/action-bridge.ts:55–75](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/pages/action-bridge.ts#L55-L75); [packages/shared/src/views/evaluator.ts:1–65](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/views/evaluator.ts#L1-L65).

**Requirements:** Grant revocation/source disable affects active page immediately.

**DoD:** Malicious iframe cannot invoke another page's source action.

**Full functional verification:** Swap frame/page/session IDs, replay nonce/request and revoke source.

**Test method:** Broker/source-gate/MCP/script executor integration tests.

#### [SVC-032.2] Data refresh, views and publishing readback

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Pages backend and canonical content handlers changed; exact010 browser creation writes real private page.json and survives same-profile restart. Native docs descriptor/block-tree/markdown commit service adds a separate canonical document pipeline.

**Full functional verification:** Refresh while editing, reopen custom views and import/share bundle.

**Test method:** View/data-store/publisher tests plus live client readback.

### [SVC-033] Code intelligence and optional SBOM services

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Off-by-default provider registry records operation capabilities, runtime/ref/digest evidence and approval-scoped egress; verified snapshots use commit-proven files. Scoped RPC rechecks policy/freshness/cancellation. Manifest is explicitly not upstream runtime verification.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Provision each supported provider only after provenance, model/runtime digest and actual account/API acceptance; test trusted repository snapshots, path containment, revocation mid-query and remote egress denial. Verify optional SBOM/service packaging separately.

**Requirements:** Supported languages/size limits and repository access grants documented; output citations match checked-out revision.

**DoD:** Index/explain/navigation and supported SBOM output function on authorized repos without private data leakage.

**Full functional verification:** Index fixtures and a real repo, edit files, follow citations, deny a foreign path and remove Syft.

**Test method:** Code-intelligence adapter/explainer/SBOM tests plus actual installed tool acceptance.

Define opt-in supported Syft versions per OS/server and parse/validate actual SBOM artifacts. **Targets:** A/B: authorized local repositories; C: server-uploaded/checked-out repositories.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/code-intelligence/local-adapter.ts:1–84](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/code-intelligence/local-adapter.ts#L1-L84); [packages/shared/src/code-intelligence/sbom.ts:1–23](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/code-intelligence/sbom.ts#L1-L23); [packages/shared/src/code-intelligence/explainer.ts:30–49](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/code-intelligence/explainer.ts#L30-L49).

**Requirements:** Missing tool visibly unavailable; successful output structurally valid.

**DoD:** Installed scanner produces artifact that can be opened/exported.

**Full functional verification:** Run with no Syft then with supported binary against real repo.

**Test method:** Runner contract tests plus native Syft smoke.

### [SVC-034] Environment preferences, OS discovery and git execution

**Reconciled implementation:** partially_implemented — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Stored-config portable path tests and storage changes reduce absolute-path portability issues. No candidate change repairs default-microservices hardcoded macOS folders or turns connected folder pointers into healthy daemons.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Deliver capability/health-aware OS source discovery on Windows/macOS and honest unsupported behavior in hosted WebUI; validate Git cwd, binary path, credentials and import/export relocation without implicit execution.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/sources/default-microservices.ts#L117-L126); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/sources/default-microservices.ts#L76-L96); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/environment/storage.ts#L1-L33); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/git/exec.ts#L1-L60); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/shared/src/config/storage.ts#L1-L90)


**Status:** Observed macOS-specific default local folders; platform gap. **Targets:** A: Windows app/Telegram discovery; B: macOS access controls; C: server filesystem only.

Default 'applications' and 'telegram-support' sources are folder pointers using macOS paths and connected status without existence validation. Implement platform-aware defaults and ensure saved environment choices actually control model/audio/browser/runtime placement and git behavior.

**Requirements:** Actual existence/access/capability drives status; local vs hosted filesystem and placement choices are explicit.

**DoD:** Windows defaults point to usable locations; unavailable data is shown accurately; preference changes affect runtime behavior.

**Full functional verification:** Fresh startup per OS/server, deny folder access, change placement preferences and execute git in path with spaces.

**Test method:** Default-source/environment/git tests plus native host acceptance.

**Full functional verification:** Change preferences, start session, run status/diff in Unicode/space path.

**Test method:** Environment/config and git subprocess integration matrix.

### [SVC-035] Command gateway and privileged execution authorization

**Reconciled implementation:** verification_still_required — source_implemented_with_bounded_recorded_verification.

**Observed branch progress:** Native authorization/fences provide relevant substrate; command-gateway privileged execution implementation is not replaced or accepted by those tests.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Prove privilege escalation consent, per-principal/source command restrictions, safe argv/cwd/env, Windows elevation/macOS prompt cancellation and cleanup. Hosted service must deny unsupported local privilege paths; audit all indirect tool entry points.

**Requirements:** Approvals scoped to authenticated user/workspace/session and exact immutable command; no generic privilege bypass.

**DoD:** Denied/expired/replayed/mismatched approval never executes; approved effect produces durable accurate receipt.

**Full functional verification:** Approve a harmless command, restart before execution, mutate payload, replay approval and test timeout/elevation denial.

**Test method:** Pending-command/privileged-policy/broker suites plus actual OS permission scenarios.

**Status:** Existing local state; no billing API implied by local balance. **Targets:** A/B: local persistence; C: per-account state and authoritative balance.

Certify XP events, quests, ratings and consent independently of account billing. Local balance is explicitly nullable without billing API; connect real account balance only through authenticated ROX service readback and prevent global hosted gamification state leakage.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/gamification/storage.ts:32–49](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/gamification/storage.ts#L32-L49); [packages/shared/src/gamification/quests.ts:1–80](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/gamification/quests.ts#L1-L80); [packages/shared/src/auth/rox-cloud.ts:136–155](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/auth/rox-cloud.ts#L136-L155).

**Requirements:** XP/quest award rules idempotent and account-scoped; billing values authoritative; analytics consent enforced.

**DoD:** User progress persists without duplicate rewards and unrelated users never share state.

**Full functional verification:** Complete a quest twice, retry event after restart, change consent and compare displayed balance to real service.

**Test method:** Gamification/quest/auth tests plus two-account runtime acceptance.

#### [SVC-036.1] Per-account progress and idempotent rewards

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

**Observed branch progress:** Session completion XP path and focused test are modified; unrelated quests/balance/live-account correctness and durable replay acceptance are not established.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Integrate and verify the original subtask outcome for 'Per-account progress and idempotent rewards', reusing the parent source changes.

**Requirements:** Retries cannot grant repeated XP for one completed action.

**DoD:** Two accounts retain distinct quests and ratings after restart.

**Full functional verification:** Replay completed event and log in as another hosted user.

**Test method:** Gamification state/retry/isolation integration tests.

#### [SVC-036.2] Balance and analytics consent integration

**Reconciled implementation:** remaining_acceptance_after_parent_reconciliation — inherits_parent_bounded_scope.

Use authenticated cloud balance where offered; show unavailable when no authoritative billing integration; gate analytics transmission. **Targets:** A/B: local persistence; C: per-account state and authoritative balance.

**Code references:** [packages/shared/src/gamification/storage.ts:32–49](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/gamification/storage.ts#L32-L49); [packages/shared/src/gamification/quests.ts:1–80](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/gamification/quests.ts#L1-L80); [packages/shared/src/auth/rox-cloud.ts:136–155](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/auth/rox-cloud.ts#L136-L155).

**Requirements:** No fabricated credits and no analytics when consent is false.

**DoD:** UI balance matches service and toggled-off consent stops sends.

**Full functional verification:** Inspect balance response/UI and network requests after consent revoke.

**Test method:** Balance contract and consent egress tests.

### [SVC-037] Managed OpenClaw runtime and audit collectors

**Reconciled implementation:** observed_gap_retained — source_inspected_or_compiler_only.

**Observed branch progress:** No candidate delta to managed OpenClaw lifecycle/audit collectors; Windows collectors remain unsupported pending owned JobObject child supervision. Existing local/optional endpoint state is not a production service deployment.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Complete Windows child ownership/termination, signed runtime provenance, gateway auth and platform-specific audit capability; test actual install/start/stop/restart/revoke and hosted remote pairing with authorized accounts.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/openclaw/collectors.ts#L158-L175); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/openclaw/collectors.ts#L326-L345); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/openclaw/runtime-manager.ts#L807-L825)


**Status:** Observed Windows audit process deliberately unsupported pending Job Object ownership. **Targets:** A: implement native job ownership or expose unsupported audit; B: owned POSIX child; C: tenant-owned runtime.

Certify install/config/runtime ownership, credential storage, port blocks, health, audit collectors, redaction, stop/restart and persistence. Windows collectors explicitly refuse to spawn audit children until native Job Object ownership is available.

**Code references:** [packages/server-core/src/openclaw/collectors.ts:158–175](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/openclaw/collectors.ts#L158-L175); [packages/server-core/src/openclaw/collectors.ts:326–345](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/openclaw/collectors.ts#L326-L345); [packages/server-core/src/openclaw/runtime-manager.ts:807–825](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/openclaw/runtime-manager.ts#L807-L825).

**Requirements:** Runtime and audit dependencies actually shipped; process ownership and supported platform capability truthful.

**DoD:** Managed runtime starts/stops/restarts without foreign process control; supported audit produces real bounded evidence.

**Full functional verification:** Install runtime in clean workspace, start, audit, crash/restart, deny credentials and check orphan processes.

**Test method:** OpenClaw collector/audit/runtime-manager suites plus actual managed runtime acceptance.

#### [SVC-037.1] Close Windows audit process ownership gap

**Requirements:** No unsupported spawn until safe ownership exists.

**DoD:** Audit succeeds when supported and leaves no descendant process.

**Full functional verification:** Run audit spawning grandchildren, cancel/timeout/parent exit on Windows.

**Test method:** Collector/native ownership tests and Windows process inspection.

## [SVC-VERIFY] Service audit acceptance record

Before calling this backlog complete as an implementation program, record for each task/subtask: owner, target, build SHA, environment, fixture/live provider, commands, result, output/readback artifact and unresolved limits. Run existing relevant suites using `bun test <actual test paths>`; use package scripts for packages that provide `typecheck`/`validate`. A test that substitutes MemoryDaytonaClient, fake workflow gateways, stub runner, local-only team adapter or in-memory replica cannot satisfy the live functional DoD. Verify deployed account integrations only in dedicated authorized test accounts; paid provider acceptance belongs to the later implementation/release phase.

The companion integration/test/recheck backlog supplies cross-module journeys and final Windows 10/11, macOS and hosted web release gates. Service owners must link their evidence into those gates after all component DoDs pass.
