# [INT-QA-RECHECK] Separate integration, testing, rechecking and delivery backlog

**Current scope:** Historical `main` findings below are retained as the baseline. Each task now carries branch reconciliation and remaining work. Read [09 — source reconciliation](09-source-reconciliation.md) and the latest candidate checks before assigning implementation. A baseline gap may already have a branch implementation.

Pinned source: `f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12`. A = Windows 10/11, B = macOS, C = hosted web. These tasks close cross-module behavior and evidence; the surface/runtime/platform lists remain separately actionable. Priorities and measurable thresholds are proposed acceptance requirements, not claims of executed results. Task dependencies: INT depends on relevant UI/SVC/platform implementations; QA follows working vertical journeys; RECHECK requires final artifacts and prior QA completion.

## [INT-001] Freeze a cross-platform capability and RPC contract

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-scoped-ci.

**Observed branch progress:** PR1322 adds authenticated bootstrap and capability-scoped renderer settings/commands with workspace authority/replica fences; no complete final cross-platform feature/RPC acceptance matrix is established.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Publish versioned capability matrix and test every enabled command on installed Windows/macOS and hosted clients, including unavailable operations.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/core/src/platform/types.ts#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/apps/electron/src/renderer/lib/authenticated-web-bootstrap.ts#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/apps/electron/src/renderer/lib/notes-write-authority.ts#L1)


**Priority / targets:** P0 · A/B/C. **Dependencies:** relevant surface and service tasks; platform capability/build fixes before installed acceptance.

**Evidence and scope:** Verification required: browser reuse, desktop APIs, server handlers and provider capabilities need a single acceptance contract. A compiling shim or advertised panel is not proof that an operation works. Source: [packages/core/src/platform/types.ts](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/core/src/platform/types.ts#L1).

**Requirements:** Every enabled navigation route and primary command maps to an authenticated implementation; unavailable capabilities produce explicit states. Complete both subtasks below and retain versioned evidence for every required target.

**DoD:** All subtask acceptance conditions pass on the same candidate, with implementation commits, observed outputs and any conditional exclusions recorded.

**Full functional verification:** Visit every route on fresh desktop and browser accounts, compare visible actions to actual negotiated capability, and attempt an unavailable operation. Then Run the same create/edit/delete action from desktop and browser; reconnect during progress and verify final state through a second client.

**Test method:** Add contract assertions against platform capability descriptors and route/command registries; fail on advertised-but-unimplemented commands. Protocol contract tests plus WS integration tests with malformed/version-mismatched payloads and event replay.

### [INT-001.1] Publish the feature and permission matrix

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-scoped-ci.

**Observed branch progress:** PR1322 adds authenticated bootstrap and capability-scoped renderer settings/commands with workspace authority/replica fences; no complete final cross-platform feature/RPC acceptance matrix is established.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Publish versioned capability matrix and test every enabled command on installed Windows/macOS and hosted clients, including unavailable operations. Apply specifically to Publish the feature and permission matrix; satisfy this subtask acceptance fields rather than inheriting parent closure.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/core/src/platform/types.ts#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/apps/electron/src/renderer/lib/authenticated-web-bootstrap.ts#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/apps/electron/src/renderer/lib/notes-write-authority.ts#L1)

**Requirements:** Classify each surface from UI/SVC/WIN/MAC/WEB as available, companion-required, conditional or excluded; include permission modes, workspace ownership and provider support.

**DoD:** Matrix has an owner, release version and executable acceptance reference for each advertised capability.

**Full functional verification:** Visit every route on fresh desktop and browser accounts, compare visible actions to actual negotiated capability, and attempt an unavailable operation.

**Test method:** Add contract assertions against platform capability descriptors and route/command registries; fail on advertised-but-unimplemented commands.

### [INT-001.2] Validate request, response and event parity

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-scoped-ci.

**Observed branch progress:** PR1322 adds authenticated bootstrap and capability-scoped renderer settings/commands with workspace authority/replica fences; no complete final cross-platform feature/RPC acceptance matrix is established.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/core/src/platform/types.ts#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/apps/electron/src/renderer/lib/authenticated-web-bootstrap.ts#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/apps/electron/src/renderer/lib/notes-write-authority.ts#L1)


**Priority / targets:** P0 · A/B/C. **Source:** [packages/core/src/platform/types.ts](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/core/src/platform/types.ts#L1).

**Requirements:** Check serialized payloads, error codes, event sequencing, disposal and workspace scope for every UI action used on A/B/C; use the typed protocol as authority.

**DoD:** Desktop and web produce compatible observable outcomes; unsupported operations return stable typed errors.

**Full functional verification:** Run the same create/edit/delete action from desktop and browser; reconnect during progress and verify final state through a second client.

**Test method:** Protocol contract tests plus WS integration tests with malformed/version-mismatched payloads and event replay.

## [INT-002] Unify ROX/Craft configuration, identity and runtime roots

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-prior-regression.

**Observed branch progress:** Alias/config isolation, durable authority/SQLite and startup migration tests are present in candidate; checkpoint includes fresh durable regression receipts at exact source010fa8c.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Verify all host launch/environment combinations and complete transactional migration/backup/rollback with real legacy profiles; target host parity is unclosed.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/shared/src/config/paths.ts#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/shared/src/config/__tests__/config-isolation.test.ts#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/authority/native-journal.ts#L1)


**Priority / targets:** P0 · A/B/C. **Dependencies:** relevant surface and service tasks; platform capability/build fixes before installed acceptance.

**Evidence and scope:** Observed migration boundary: configuration uses preferred ROX and legacy Craft aliases; import-time snapshots make process startup order relevant. Mixed aliases can select different workspaces or secrets. Source: [packages/shared/src/config/paths.ts](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/config/paths.ts#L1).

**Requirements:** Every executable resolves the same intended owned root; migrations preserve original data and never silently create a second active profile. Complete both subtasks below and retain versioned evidence for every required target.

**DoD:** All subtask acceptance conditions pass on the same candidate, with implementation commits, observed outputs and any conditional exclusions recorded.

**Full functional verification:** Create separate seeded profiles, start each host under each alias set, inspect workspace list and write a note, then verify only the selected root changed. Then Upgrade a realistic legacy profile, interrupt at each migration checkpoint, resume, restore backup and compare record/link/attachment counts.

**Test method:** Subprocess config tests using isolated temporary roots; include WebUI token alias startup and runtime-resolver propagation. Migration fault injection and golden-file semantic comparisons, including corrupt JSON/JSONL and locked files.

### [INT-002.1] Test all environment and startup combinations

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-prior-regression.

**Observed branch progress:** Alias/config isolation, durable authority/SQLite and startup migration tests are present in candidate; checkpoint includes fresh durable regression receipts at exact source010fa8c.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Requirements:** Cover ROX-only, Craft-only, both equal, both different, unset, legacy existing tree, clean tree, read-only root and Unicode paths in desktop/server/CLI/worker launches.

**DoD:** Documented precedence is consistent across hosts; startup reports actionable root errors without secrets.

**Full functional verification:** Create separate seeded profiles, start each host under each alias set, inspect workspace list and write a note, then verify only the selected root changed.

**Test method:** Subprocess config tests using isolated temporary roots; include WebUI token alias startup and runtime-resolver propagation.

### [INT-002.2] Make migrations transactional and recoverable

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-prior-regression.

**Observed branch progress:** Alias/config isolation, durable authority/SQLite and startup migration tests are present in candidate; checkpoint includes fresh durable regression receipts at exact source010fa8c.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Requirements:** Version schemas and path migrations; back up before moving or rewriting files; preserve credentials, histories, references and knowledge indexes.

**DoD:** Interrupted migrations retry safely, rollback restores readable originals, and downgraded versions do not overwrite unsupported data.

**Full functional verification:** Upgrade a realistic legacy profile, interrupt at each migration checkpoint, resume, restore backup and compare record/link/attachment counts.

**Test method:** Migration fault injection and golden-file semantic comparisons, including corrupt JSON/JSONL and locked files.

## [INT-003] Verify complete agent lifecycle across advertised backends

**Reconciled implementation:** verification-required — source-and-local-worktree-inventory.

**Observed branch progress:** Backend/provider source and protocol tests advance, but retained checkpoint explicitly excludes live providers. Original audit dirty worktree contains OMP framing changes not credited to candidate.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Execute registered Anthropic/Pi/OMP credentialed tool/permission/abort/restart/model/branch journeys under shipped runtime; preserve separate OpenClaw/Copilot contract scopes.

**Priority / targets:** P0 · A/B/C. **Dependencies:** relevant surface and service tasks; platform capability/build fixes before installed acceptance.

**Evidence and scope:** Verification required: backend adapters need equivalent stream, tool, permission and persistence behavior under the runtime shipped with each target. Source: [packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/agent/backend/factory.ts#L1).

**Requirements:** Each advertised provider passes the complete session journey, with truthful capability differences and no lost tool or thinking events. Complete both subtasks below and retain versioned evidence for every required target.

**DoD:** All subtask acceptance conditions pass on the same candidate, with implementation commits, observed outputs and any conditional exclusions recorded.

**Full functional verification:** Send a multi-tool request, deny one operation, approve another, cancel a slow tool, restart the host, and resume the session with a verifiable artifact. Then Create a parent with a source and skill, fork at two points, rotate credentials, resume children and confirm actual model and tool access.

**Test method:** Deterministic protocol fixtures plus live sandbox provider tests; correlate backend logs, events and transcript artifacts. Adapter capability tests and live branch/auth integration matrix; snapshot normalized transcripts without secrets.

### [INT-003.1] Exercise stream, tools, cancellation and restart

**Reconciled implementation:** verification-required — source-and-local-worktree-inventory.

**Observed branch progress:** Backend/provider source and protocol tests advance, but retained checkpoint explicitly excludes live providers. Original audit dirty worktree contains OMP framing changes not credited to candidate.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Requirements:** Cover the registered Anthropic/Pi/OMP backends and their advertised connection/provider combinations; test text, thinking, tool start/result, failed tool, approval deny/allow, abort and process death. Qualify Copilot connections through their actual backend and OpenClaw control/proxy flows separately instead of inventing unregistered backend drivers.

**DoD:** Terminal states settle correctly; approvals cannot execute after denial/expiry; child processes terminate and transcripts remain readable.

**Full functional verification:** Send a multi-tool request, deny one operation, approve another, cancel a slow tool, restart the host, and resume the session with a verifiable artifact.

**Test method:** Deterministic protocol fixtures plus live sandbox provider tests; correlate backend logs, events and transcript artifacts.

### [INT-003.2] Verify model selection, branching and authentication recovery

**Reconciled implementation:** verification-required — source-and-local-worktree-inventory.

**Requirements:** Check catalog refresh, default model, explicit override, supported thinking levels, mid-history branch, tail branch, expired credentials and rate limits.

**DoD:** Selected backend/model matches actual invocation; branches preserve anchors/context; errors show recovery without corrupting history.

**Full functional verification:** Create a parent with a source and skill, fork at two points, rotate credentials, resume children and confirm actual model and tool access.

**Test method:** Adapter capability tests and live branch/auth integration matrix; snapshot normalized transcripts without secrets.

## [INT-004] Close credential and OAuth journeys end to end

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-scoped-ci.

**Observed branch progress:** Cookie/bootstrap and source credential tests are integrated; workspace-service verified actor code is a separate identity path. No retained receipt closes every real provider OAuth callback/refresh/revoke journey.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset.

**Priority / targets:** P0 · A/B/C. **Dependencies:** relevant surface and service tasks; platform capability/build fixes before installed acceptance.

**Evidence and scope:** Observed shared hosted identity and multiple credential stores make callback ownership, refresh and revocation release-critical. Secret references must be dereferenced only inside their intended runtime boundary. Source: [packages/server-core/src/webui/auth.ts](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/webui/auth.ts#L1).

**Requirements:** Connection state reflects real authenticated access; revoked/expired credentials stop authorizing tools and no secret reaches UI logs or exports. Complete both subtasks below and retain versioned evidence for every required target.

**DoD:** All subtask acceptance conditions pass on the same candidate, with implementation commits, observed outputs and any conditional exclusions recorded.

**Full functional verification:** Connect a sandbox OAuth source, execute a tool, expire/refresh tokens, replay the callback, revoke externally, and retry from a second workspace. Then Save a credential, use it through an approved tool, export/share/support-bundle the session, disconnect and retry after application restart.

**Test method:** HTTP callback integration tests with malicious states plus real provider sandbox flows; inspect redacted logs and persisted envelopes. Canary-secret leakage assertions across RPC/events/files plus credential recovery and grant-expiry tests.

### [INT-004.1] Verify callback routing and token refresh on all hosts

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-scoped-ci.

**Requirements:** Cover system-browser desktop callback/deep link, hosted HTTPS callback, state/PKCE replay, cancellation, timeout, denied scopes and refresh failure.

**DoD:** OAuth result binds to initiating user/workspace/source; duplicate or forged callbacks are rejected; reauthentication is actionable.

**Full functional verification:** Connect a sandbox OAuth source, execute a tool, expire/refresh tokens, replay the callback, revoke externally, and retry from a second workspace.

**Test method:** HTTP callback integration tests with malicious states plus real provider sandbox flows; inspect redacted logs and persisted envelopes.

**Full functional verification:** Promote conflicting facts from two sessions, inspect resolution, change user/workspace, restart and verify only accepted memory affects the next answer.

**Test method:** Memory service integration tests plus conflict/replay/tombstone fixtures and canary tenant data.

## [INT-009] Integrate automation editor, scheduler and durable execution

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-scoped-ci.

**Observed branch progress:** September retry scheduler adds durable process-loss tests and is included in scoped candidate CI.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Complete genuine automation canvas→edited schedule→real side effect, timezone/DST, retry/idempotency and credential revocation journeys; fixture durability alone closes only its tested subset.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/shared/src/automations/retry-scheduler.ts#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/shared/src/automations/scheduler-process-loss-acceptance.test.ts#L1)


**Priority / targets:** P1 · A/B/C. **Dependencies:** relevant surface and service tasks; platform capability/build fixes before installed acceptance.

**Evidence and scope:** Verification required: graph/config editors and schedule runtime need a real create-to-run journey, beyond editor action unit tests. Source: [packages/server-core/src/handlers/rpc/automations-editor.test.ts](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/handlers/rpc/automations-editor.test.ts#L1).

**Requirements:** Saved automation executes the intended permitted actions once, with durable history, retries and observable failures. Complete both subtasks below and retain versioned evidence for every required target.

**DoD:** All subtask acceptance conditions pass on the same candidate, with implementation commits, observed outputs and any conditional exclusions recorded.

**Full functional verification:** Save an automation from the UI, advance controlled time through DST, restart/sleep the host and inspect run history and generated artifact. Then Force a partial network failure after a test action succeeds, retry, revoke its source and confirm exactly one external artifact.

**Test method:** Scheduler fake-clock tests combined with service/renderer E2E and one real-time scheduled sandbox run. Fault injection at commit/ack boundaries with idempotency assertions and approval audit inspection.

### [INT-009.1] Execute edited automations including timezone changes

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-scoped-ci.

**Requirements:** Create graph and schedule automations with conditions, inputs and credentials; validate invalid graphs, DST, sleep and missed triggers.

**DoD:** Saved configuration reloads identically; scheduled runs use workspace timezone and a documented missed-run policy.

**Full functional verification:** Save an automation from the UI, advance controlled time through DST, restart/sleep the host and inspect run history and generated artifact.

**Test method:** Scheduler fake-clock tests combined with service/renderer E2E and one real-time scheduled sandbox run.

**Requirements:** Set limits on retry/backoff, fan-out and execution budget; record action IDs and approvals; revoked sources disable future work.

**DoD:** Retries do not duplicate external side effects; cancellation and disabled automation stop future scheduling.

**Full functional verification:** Force a partial network failure after a test action succeeds, retry, revoke its source and confirm exactly one external artifact.

**Test method:** Fault injection at commit/ack boundaries with idempotency assertions and approval audit inspection.

## [INT-010] Integrate rich documents, collections, canvas and generated artifacts

**Requirements:** Native and browser editing preserve structure, references and attachments; supported import/export formats open in their intended applications. Complete both subtasks below and retain versioned evidence for every required target.

**DoD:** All subtask acceptance conditions pass on the same candidate, with implementation commits, observed outputs and any conditional exclusions recorded.

**Full functional verification:** Compose a representative document, edit from a second client, disconnect, reconnect, export, reimport and compare blocks/links/attachments. Then Generate each supported format in the installed app, open it with an independent reader and inspect content/metadata; repeat on a hosted runner.

**Test method:** Semantic fixture roundtrip tests plus UI editing E2E, offline/conflict recovery and actual exported-file open checks. Existing test:doc-tools plus final-artifact subprocess tests and independent format validators; no developer PATH fallback.

See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Review local deltas into isolated commits, then qualify real invite/role/revoke/conflict/shared-run integration against deployed workspace-service; standalone UI source is insufficient.

**Priority / targets:** P0 for multi-user hosting · A/B/C. **Dependencies:** relevant surface and service tasks; platform capability/build fixes before installed acceptance.

**Evidence and scope:** Verification required: invite UI and shared resources must use enforceable server grants and user identity rather than shared instance password assumptions. Source: [packages/server-core/src/collaboration/bro-invite-service.ts](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/collaboration/bro-invite-service.ts#L1).

**Requirements:** Invites, roles and ownership are enforced across HTTP/RPC/events/storage/runner paths with revocation and no cross-account disclosure. Complete both subtasks below and retain versioned evidence for every required target.

**DoD:** All subtask acceptance conditions pass on the same candidate, with implementation commits, observed outputs and any conditional exclusions recorded.

**Full functional verification:** Invite two sandbox users, accept, downgrade/revoke one while a shared session is open, then retry edit/search/download/run operations. Then Edit a shared note simultaneously, run a task as viewer/editor, reconnect and inspect canonical content and execution audit.

**Test method:** Multi-client RBAC integration and permission-change event tests using unrelated identities. Concurrency/property tests with deterministic clocks plus live multi-client E2E.

### [INT-013.1] Verify invite acceptance and role transitions

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-local-worktree-inventory.

**Observed branch progress:** Compound workspace-service actor/membership/domain source is integrated; candidate includes source authority tests. Dirty Compound worktree contains further organization/admin/collaboration source.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Review local deltas into isolated commits, then qualify real invite/role/revoke/conflict/shared-run integration against deployed workspace-service; standalone UI source is insufficient. Apply specifically to Verify invite acceptance and role transitions; satisfy this subtask acceptance fields rather than inheriting parent closure.

**Requirements:** Define organization/team membership, resource owner, editor/viewer permissions, expiry and role changes; connect grants to actual server handlers.

**DoD:** Invalid/expired invites are rejected; roles change live; ownership transfer preserves data and an audit trail.

**Full functional verification:** Invite two sandbox users, accept, downgrade/revoke one while a shared session is open, then retry edit/search/download/run operations.

**Test method:** Multi-client RBAC integration and permission-change event tests using unrelated identities.

### [INT-013.2] Verify collaboration conflict and shared run attribution

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-local-worktree-inventory.

**Observed branch progress:** Compound workspace-service actor/membership/domain source is integrated; candidate includes source authority tests. Dirty Compound worktree contains further organization/admin/collaboration source.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Requirements:** Resolve concurrent edits and agent execution ownership; expose who changed what and what source/credential grant was used.

**DoD:** No lost update or ambiguous billing/secret authority; shared activity is attributable and scoped.

**Full functional verification:** Edit a shared note simultaneously, run a task as viewer/editor, reconnect and inspect canonical content and execution audit.

**Test method:** Concurrency/property tests with deterministic clocks plus live multi-client E2E.

## [INT-014] Integrate Cloud Runs from the product UI to real execution and artifacts

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-scoped-ci.

**Observed branch progress:** Cloud runner source and budget ownership process-loss tests are integrated; build-server now packages cloud-runner. Checkpoint is explicitly bounded and excludes live provider execution.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Qualify actual advertised Daytona/local/native runner provisioning, controlled grants/budgets, UI logs/artifacts/hash readback, cancellation/restart and revoked credentials.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/scripts/build-server.ts#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/shared/src/agent/core/__tests__/budget-owner-process-acceptance.test.ts#L1)


**Priority / targets:** P0 when Cloud Runs is advertised · A/B/C. **Dependencies:** UI Cloud Runs, SVC provider/state/gate tasks, hosted ownership and staged runtime resources. **Evidence:** the active registry selects Daytona/local/native [public-registry.ts](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/public-registry.ts#L8); existing [provider conformance](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/conformance.ts#L20-L114) checks handles, terminal states, artifacts, traversal and cancellation. Local defaults and reference stubs require explicit separation from real execution.

**Requirements:** Bind UI run selection and input resources to the actual provider, permissions and durable workspace context. Enforce provisioning/cost gates at every entrypoint. Preserve ordered events, truthful process exit/error state, artifact ownership and recoverable cancellation/reconnect.

**DoD:** Each advertised provider executes a real verifiable workload through the UI, produces byte-exact authorized artifacts, settles the correct terminal state, and passes conformance plus lifecycle integration. Stub runs remain labeled simulation and cannot satisfy a real execution DoD.

**Full functional verification:** Start a controlled file-producing run from desktop and browser, confirm selected backend and remote/local process, disconnect/restart, reconnect, download output and compare its hash. Repeat with a nonzero process exit, cancellation, expired grant and exhausted budget.

**Test method:** Extend/map the existing conformance suite, exercise UI→RPC→provider→event/artifact storage E2E, and read back an actual sandbox artifact for each required provider. Paid provisioning requires an explicitly configured test budget and authorization; otherwise record not-run.

### [INT-014.1] Verify real runner state, artifact fidelity and cancellation

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-scoped-ci.

**Observed branch progress:** Cloud runner source and budget ownership process-loss tests are integrated; build-server now packages cloud-runner. Checkpoint is explicitly bounded and excludes live provider execution.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Qualify actual advertised Daytona/local/native runner provisioning, controlled grants/budgets, UI logs/artifacts/hash readback, cancellation/restart and revoked credentials. Apply specifically to Verify real runner state, artifact fidelity and cancellation; satisfy this subtask acceptance fields rather than inheriting parent closure.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/scripts/build-server.ts#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/shared/src/agent/core/__tests__/budget-owner-process-acceptance.test.ts#L1)


**Priority / targets:** P0 when Cloud Runs is advertised · A/B/C. **Source:** [provider conformance](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/cloud-runner/src/conformance.ts#L20-L114).

**Requirements:** Exercise selected provider start/status/events/artifact/cancel contracts, duplicate start IDs, unknown IDs, slow output and process exits. Trace the displayed terminal state to actual execution rather than a reference runner.

**DoD:** Successful runs have expected files and exit status; failed exits are failed, cancellation halts work, and duplicate retries do not create extra runs or chargeable environments.

**Full functional verification:** Generate a known binary and text artifact, stream progress, reconnect, verify downloads, run a command that exits nonzero, then cancel an active long run and inspect the actual process/sandbox state.

**Test method:** Existing conformance plus a real workload harness and UI E2E; compare checksums, ordered event IDs, provider process status and persisted run terminal state.

### [INT-014.2] Verify grants, budgets, provisioning gates and durable recovery

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-scoped-ci.

**Observed branch progress:** Cloud runner source and budget ownership process-loss tests are integrated; build-server now packages cloud-runner. Checkpoint is explicitly bounded and excludes live provider execution.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Priority / targets:** P0 when Cloud Runs is advertised · A/B/C. **Source:** [Cloud Runs RPC](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/server-core/src/handlers/rpc/cloud-runs.ts#L254-L267).

**Requirements:** Check owner/workspace grants for run start, status, event subscription and artifact download. Apply budget/paid-provisioning policy to every direct and indirect run creation route; persist recoverable handles and secrets separately.

**DoD:** Denied/exhausted requests provision zero environments; another workspace cannot observe/control a run; host restart recovers one authoritative run with its logs and outputs or a truthful orphan error.

**Full functional verification:** Attempt a run through every entrypoint with provisioning disabled, enable an authorized sandbox budget, start one run, restart the host and request its logs/artifacts from an unauthorized client and its owner.

**Test method:** Entry-point enforcement regression tests, cross-workspace canaries, budget/race assertions, and restart E2E with provider inventory readback.

## [INT-015] Integrate voice capture, transcription, history and approved actions

**Reconciled implementation:** verification-required — source-and-local-worktree-inventory.

**Observed branch progress:** Voice source exists, while original audit dirty worktree lists STT/TTS/OMP tooling and new Edge TTS adapter/tests not committed in candidate.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Select/review local voice deltas and verify real microphone capture/STT/TTS/history/export/retention and approval-gated actions on all supported target runtimes.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/handlers/rpc/voice.ts#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/shared/src/voice/transcribe.ts#L1)


**Priority / targets:** P1 when voice is advertised · A/B/C. **Dependencies:** voice/media platform tasks, provider auth, file upload, history persistence and action permissions. **Evidence:** [voice runtime](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/voice/runtime.ts#L1) and [history store](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/voice/history-store.ts#L1) implement separate concerns that need a complete user journey.

**Requirements:** Capture from a supported input, upload ordered audio chunks, transcribe with an authorized provider, expose editable transcript/history/export and apply any derived action only under the chosen permission contract. Handle microphone denial, interruption, lost chunks, language selection and server versus client media ownership.

**DoD:** A real recording yields an accurate attributable transcript, playable retained audio according to policy and usable persisted history. Errors/cancellation leave no phantom completed recording; external/agent side effects follow explicit approval where required.

**Full functional verification:** Record a known multilingual sample on each target, interrupt the connection, recover or cancel, review/edit/export transcript, restart and reopen history, then approve one derived sandbox action and deny another.

**Test method:** Audio fixtures for chunk ordering/provider responses, real target microphone capture and provider sandbox transcription, history readback/export validation and approval side-effect canaries.

### [INT-015.1] Verify capture-to-transcript and media error recovery

**Reconciled implementation:** verification-required — source-and-local-worktree-inventory.

**Observed branch progress:** Dirty original audit worktree lists transcribe/toolchain/system-tts/Edge TTS source and tests; these local deltas are not candidate1322 commits.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Review/commit/integrate intended local capture/STT/TTS changes without discarding user work, then qualify real media devices and failure recovery on each supported host.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server-core/src/handlers/rpc/voice.ts#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/shared/src/voice/transcribe.ts#L1)


**Priority / targets:** P1 when voice is advertised · A/B/C. **Source:** [voice runtime](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/shared/src/voice/runtime.ts#L1).

**Requirements:** Test device switching, permission denial, muted/silent input, chunk ordering, reconnect, long recordings, provider timeout and language hints in desktop and browser HTTPS contexts.

**DoD:** UI capture state matches microphone/provider state; no duplicate/lost chunks in successful recovery; unsupported recovery stops with an actionable error and retains only permitted data.

**Full functional verification:** Record speech with known timestamps/language, deny and later grant microphone permission, disconnect halfway, resume/retry transcription and compare text/audio alignment.

**Test method:** Controlled media fixtures and chunk fault injection plus real microphone/provider E2E; inspect server audio hashes/timestamps and transcript provenance.

### [INT-015.2] Verify durable history, export, retention and action gating

**Reconciled implementation:** verification-required — source-and-local-worktree-inventory.

**Observed branch progress:** Voice source exists, while original audit dirty worktree lists STT/TTS/OMP tooling and new Edge TTS adapter/tests not committed in candidate.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Select/review local voice deltas and verify real microphone capture/STT/TTS/history/export/retention and approval-gated actions on all supported target runtimes.

**Requirements:** Persist transcript edits and recording references with workspace ownership; verify export, retention/deletion and whether dictated instructions require confirmation before agent/tool execution.

**DoD:** History survives restart and resolves its owned media; export faithfully represents edits; deleted/revoked media is inaccessible; denied actions execute no side effects.

**Full functional verification:** Edit/export a transcript, restart, switch workspace, attempt unauthorized audio retrieval, approve/deny two sandbox actions and expire/delete the recording.

**Test method:** History/ACL/retention integration tests, independent exported-file validation and actual action readback with approval canaries.

## [QA-001] Replace placeholder CI and reconcile executable validation commands

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-observed-ci-metadata.

**Observed branch progress:** PR1317 and PR1322 replace lifecycle echo with executable Pi/WebUI/server build and fixture smoke. CI Validate Alias actually invokes validate:ci; separate SQLite recovery is scoped Ubuntu/macOS durable/transport/renderer regression plus builds. Independent de805 recheck: Bun1.4.2 server build passes but built-server lifecycle exits1 (3pass/1fail), startup ReferenceError exports_tmp undefined. CI-pinned Bun1.3.14 built-server lifecycle comparison now PASSes; Bun1.4.2 failure is version-specific observed compatibility risk. Qualify and enforce supported build/runtime versions.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Credit source repair and observed job metadata within scope; include omitted workspaces, frozen toolchain consistency, Windows jobs/native artifacts and actual end-to-end acceptance. Do not equate green scoped jobs with whole-release signoff.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/.github/workflows/validate-server.yml#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/.github/workflows/sqlite-runtime-recovery.yml#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/package.json#L1)


**Priority / targets:** P0 · A/B/C. **Dependencies:** relevant surface and service tasks; platform capability/build fixes before installed acceptance.

**Evidence and scope:** Observed gap: server lifecycle job echoes that its smoke is not implemented. Several root scripts point to absent OSS paths, and Bun versions vary across runners. Source: [.github/workflows/validate-server.yml](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/.github/workflows/validate-server.yml#L1).

**Requirements:** Every required job runs a substantive check on the exact release source; missing prerequisites or skipped release-critical tests fail explicitly. Complete both subtasks below and retain versioned evidence for every required target.

**DoD:** All subtask acceptance conditions pass on the same candidate, with implementation commits, observed outputs and any conditional exclusions recorded.

**Full functional verification:** Inspect CI logs/artifacts showing a real bound port, authenticated request, emitted events, saved session and process cleanup. Then Run the required matrix on fork branch and read back result/check artifacts, including unavailable runner status as a failure to deliver evidence.

**Test method:** Wire packages/server smoke and transport/auth integration suites into validate-server; force a regression to prove job failure. Command-existence audit, frozen install and package typecheck/build matrix; remove placeholder skip semantics.

### [QA-001.1] Replace lifecycle echo with isolated server behavior checks

**Reconciled implementation:** implemented-scope-verification-remaining — source-and-observed-scoped-ci-metadata.

**Observed branch progress:** The old lifecycle echo is replaced at PR1317/1322 by real Pi/WebUI/server build and packages/server/src/__tests__/smoke.test.ts. PR1322 lifecycle check has observed SUCCESS metadata.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Retain fixture scope and exact-head runtime receipts; expand to adverse host lifecycle/deployment scenarios required by this subtask. No installed-native/provider acceptance is implied.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/.github/workflows/validate-server.yml#L64); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/.github/workflows/validate-server.yml#L77); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/packages/server/src/__tests__/smoke.test.ts#L1)

**Requirements:** Start a fresh server, authenticate, list/create workspaces and sessions, stream a fixture agent/tool turn, reconnect and shut down cleanly.

**DoD:** CI verifies real HTTP/WS behavior and persistent state; expected failures are asserted; no success-only echo or silent skip.

**Full functional verification:** Inspect CI logs/artifacts showing a real bound port, authenticated request, emitted events, saved session and process cleanup.

**Test method:** Wire packages/server smoke and transport/auth integration suites into validate-server; force a regression to prove job failure.

### [QA-001.2] Pin toolchain and complete the required job matrix

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-observed-ci-metadata.

**Observed branch progress:** PR1317 and PR1322 replace lifecycle echo with executable Pi/WebUI/server build and fixture smoke. CI Validate Alias actually invokes validate:ci; separate SQLite recovery is scoped Ubuntu/macOS durable/transport/renderer regression plus builds. Independent de805 recheck: Bun1.4.2 server build passes but built-server lifecycle exits1 (3pass/1fail), startup ReferenceError exports_tmp undefined. CI-pinned Bun1.3.14 built-server lifecycle comparison now PASSes; Bun1.4.2 failure is version-specific observed compatibility risk. Qualify and enforce supported build/runtime versions.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Credit source repair and observed job metadata within scope; include omitted workspaces, frozen toolchain consistency, Windows jobs/native artifacts and actual end-to-end acceptance.

**Requirements:** Unify Bun/Node/Electron/builder versions or document intentional differences; frozen lock install; include web/viewer/CLI/workers/cloud/native where shipped.

**DoD:** Clean clone CI resolves identical inputs; all supported package commands exist; Windows/macOS/hosted jobs have provisioned runners.

**Full functional verification:** Run the required matrix on fork branch and read back result/check artifacts, including unavailable runner status as a failure to deliver evidence.

**Test method:** Command-existence audit, frozen install and package typecheck/build matrix; remove placeholder skip semantics.

## [QA-002] Guarantee tests cannot mutate live user profiles or infrastructure

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-prior-regression.

**Observed branch progress:** Config isolation tests and subprocess temporary-root receipts exist; checkpoint records bounded cleanup. Dirty Compound includes additional packaging cleanup/containment work.

**Priority / targets:** P0 · A/B/C. **Dependencies:** relevant surface and service tasks; platform capability/build fixes before installed acceptance.

**Evidence and scope:** Observed design: config root is snapshotted at import time and both aliases must be controlled. Tests and subprocesses must not inherit live runtime state. Source: [scripts/test-config-isolation.ts](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/scripts/test-config-isolation.ts#L1).

**Requirements:** All automated tests operate on disposable owned roots and sandbox credentials; cleanup targets only artifacts created by the test. Complete both subtasks below and retain versioned evidence for every required target.

**DoD:** All subtask acceptance conditions pass on the same candidate, with implementation commits, observed outputs and any conditional exclusions recorded.

**Full functional verification:** Seed sentinel files in external profiles, execute root and per-package tests plus child-process cases, compare sentinels and owned writes. Then Interrupt a test run during active subprocess/tool work, rerun it and verify clean ports/config roots and readable diagnostics.

**Test method:** Run config-isolation suite and filesystem/network canary harness; assert preload parity and explicit external-service gating. Lifecycle teardown tests, process group checks and cleanup fault injection; restrict deletion to generated temp roots.

**Requirements:** Register teardown for temporary dirs, sockets, spawned processes, browsers and workers; retain only deliberate diagnostic artifacts.

**DoD:** Failed tests leave no orphan process, active timer, bound port or usable secret; preserved evidence is redacted.

**Full functional verification:** Interrupt a test run during active subprocess/tool work, rerun it and verify clean ports/config roots and readable diagnostics.

## [QA-003] Build an end-user E2E matrix across all required targets

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — prior-bounded-ui-evidence.

**Observed branch progress:** Retained historical a4ca checkpoint is supplemented by a newer exact010 production browser execution: 99 main passes,11 auth passes,22 root routes,22 settings,7 mode clicks and64 screenshots.

**Requirements:** Every release-critical UI/SVC capability has a passing complete user journey on the final supported target matrix. Complete both subtasks below and retain versioned evidence for every required target.

**DoD:** All subtask acceptance conditions pass on the same candidate, with implementation commits, observed outputs and any conditional exclusions recorded.

**Full functional verification:** Start a fresh profile on each OS/browser, perform journeys through UI, restart and verify resulting work from a second client/independent file reader. Then Run each key journey with injected faults, standard OS accounts, supported resolutions, keyboard input and reduced motion.

**Test method:** Electron Playwright plus browser Playwright, native OS automation where required, with trace/video and server artifact capture. Parameterized E2E matrix with controlled fault server; manual native permission/installer verification where automation cannot assert OS state.

**Requirements:** Define expected users/workspaces/concurrent runs; include slow clients, reconnect storms, oversized uploads and expensive indexing.

**DoD:** Quotas/backpressure isolate workloads and stay within declared cost/SLO; overload rejects work without dropping persisted results.

**Full functional verification:** Run the agreed workload against staging, increase concurrency to failure, verify rejected requests and recover service after load stops.

**Test method:** Load harness with p95/p99, error rate, queue depth and cost metrics; validate fairness across distinct workspaces and, when shared tenancy is selected, distinct tenants.

## [QA-006] Verify security boundaries with hostile content and hostile clients

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-scoped-security-evidence.

**Observed branch progress:** PR1322 adds auth/workspace authority regressions and retained browser auth-negative evidence. Snapshot has successful CodeQL analyses but also a failed aggregate CodeQL check and failed Vercel status.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Requirements:** A renderer/browser client cannot bypass grants, approval, filesystem ownership or secret boundaries through malformed content or direct API calls. Complete both subtasks below and retain versioned evidence for every required target.

**DoD:** All subtask acceptance conditions pass on the same candidate, with implementation commits, observed outputs and any conditional exclusions recorded.

**Full functional verification:** Open a controlled malicious fixture in chat/note/viewer/browser surfaces; attempt IPC and navigation abuse and inspect canary files and network endpoints. Then Use a low-privilege direct HTTP/WS client to request another workspace file, run, secret and event stream; revoke session during tool execution.

**Test method:** Electron security configuration assertions plus malicious-content E2E and manual boundary review against official Electron security guidance. API adversarial integration suite with per-tenant canaries, audit assertions and fuzzed protocol/resource inputs.

**Requirements:** Cover HTML/Markdown/URL injection, external navigation, webview content, malicious attachments, preload API abuse and unsolicited permission requests.

**DoD:** Untrusted content does not execute privileged code or disclose credentials; browser/native launch rules enforce allowed schemes and origins.

**Full functional verification:** Open a controlled malicious fixture in chat/note/viewer/browser surfaces; attempt IPC and navigation abuse and inspect canary files and network endpoints.

**Test method:** Electron security configuration assertions plus malicious-content E2E and manual boundary review against official Electron security guidance.

**Requirements:** Cover WebSocket Origin/peer trust, CSRF-like upgrades, expired/replayed cookies, workspace ID swapping, traversal, symlink escapes and malicious tool definitions.

**DoD:** Every operation checks current identity/grant; denial occurs before any side effect; privileged execution cannot escape its allowed root.

**Full functional verification:** Use a low-privilege direct HTTP/WS client to request another workspace file, run, secret and event stream; revoke session during tool execution.

**Test method:** API adversarial integration suite with per-tenant canaries, audit assertions and fuzzed protocol/resource inputs.

## [QA-007] Verify backup, restoration and data integrity under failures

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-prior-regression.

**Requirements:** Documented backups restore a usable product within agreed RPO/RTO; corruption or full disks do not silently discard user data. Complete both subtasks below and retain versioned evidence for every required target.

**DoD:** All subtask acceptance conditions pass on the same candidate, with implementation commits, observed outputs and any conditional exclusions recorded.

**Full functional verification:** Back up a seeded active workspace, restore under a different user/path or staging host, reopen every core artifact and resume a sandbox session. Then Kill the test host during save/run/index, fill its owned volume, damage selected fixture records and verify recovery messages and canonical data.

**Test method:** Backup manifest/checksum validation and automated restore E2E, plus manual secret-recovery confirmation without printing values. Filesystem fault harness and process-kill recovery tests; compare persisted state to acknowledged operation log.

**Requirements:** Drain/flush sessions and queues, stop workers/listeners, recover orphaned runs and use an explicit service supervisor/deployment restart policy.

**DoD:** Restart yields one active owner per channel/queue; no stuck port, duplicate scheduled job or lost acknowledged result.

**Full functional verification:** Terminate host during a stream, messaging reconnect and cloud run; restart, reconnect clients and inspect final state and worker count.

**Test method:** Chaos/lifecycle tests with supervisor restart and persisted-state assertions; staged deployment drain/rollback rehearsal.

## [QA-010] Repair the observed TypeScript baseline and qualify every workspace independently

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-independent-local-recheck.

**Observed branch progress:** PR1292/1317/1315/1319 and candidate1322 contain TypeScript/core/runtime fixes and qualified scoped gates; main-only 13/17/33/8 diagnostics must not be transferred unchanged to these heads. Independent candidate qualification now reports root typecheck:all PASS and 16/18 workspace PASS; viewer fails two TS2550 Object.hasOwn diagnostics and messaging-gateway fails 123 TypeScript diagnostic occurrences.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Repair viewer ES2022 Object.hasOwn lib contract and messaging-gateway source/type graph (123 diagnostic occurrences); retain the passing core/shared/server-core/server gates and include every omitted workspace in required CI. Root typecheck:all PASS is narrower than all-workspace acceptance.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/package.json#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/.github/workflows/sqlite-runtime-recovery.yml#L1)


**Priority / targets:** P0 · A/B/C. **Dependencies:** canonical result/protocol contracts, meetings, voice, workspace handlers and renderer shared types. The audit deliberately records these failures without modifying application code.

**Observed evidence:** `bun run typecheck:all` exits 2 in its first package (`packages/core`) with 13 diagnostics. Twelve diagnostics affect tests (calendar narrowing and access to `verification` on legacy-or-canonical results); one production diagnostic is the comparison to an invalid verification value in [meeting-conation-shell.ts:24–33](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/f63294ba4fffa7238b46b24e918925a313ad0b12/packages/core/src/rox2/meeting-conation-shell.ts#L24-L33). Independent downstream checks also fail; the exact command/package/diagnostic inventory is in [07-verification.md](07-verification.md).

**Requirements:** Correct actual type/contracts rather than hiding errors with broad casts, disabling strict checks or excluding failing production code/tests. Validate the configured source sets of every shipped workspace after correcting shared root causes. Keep a separate record of repeated imported diagnostics so counts are not mistaken for unique defects.

**DoD:** The complete required workspace typecheck matrix passes on the pinned release toolchain; every affected runtime behavior and test assertion is consistent with the corrected contract. `typecheck:all` completes its full chain, and web/viewer/CLI/workers/cloud packages omitted from that chain have explicit gates when shipped.

**Full functional verification:** Exercise canonical/legacy result normalization, queued meeting projections, live/readback proof, calendar task/event merging, voice upload/transcription and workspace/label/messaging actions. Verify that queued/unverified work cannot appear as successful or externally verified.

**Test method:** Run corrected contract tests and independent package typechecks, then `bun run typecheck:all` and the affected meeting/calendar/voice/handler E2E. Preserve exact versions and logs; a passing Vite bundle is not a substitute for type correctness.

### [QA-010.1] Reconcile canonical result states and discriminated test assertions

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-independent-local-recheck.

**Observed branch progress:** Core discriminated-state/type contracts and CI fixes exist on later branch heads. Baseline main diagnostics are historical observations rather than proof those defects remain in candidate.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Remaining work after reconciliation:** Use independent exact-head packages/core and dependent compilation logs; repair only remaining diagnostics and retain result-state behavioral tests.

**Reviewed branch code:** [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/package.json#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L1); [branch source](https://github.com/rox-one/rox-one/blob/de805e0dc7103b49d4c7f0a092d88c8b4222367a/.github/workflows/sqlite-runtime-recovery.yml#L1)

**Requirements:** Replace the impossible comparison to `verified` with a check consistent with the canonical verification enum and intended invariant; normalize or narrow legacy result unions before reading canonical fields. Replace the tautological already-narrowed calendar assertion with a behavioral check of merged event/task contents.

**DoD:** Core typecheck has zero diagnostics; tests still reject invalid live/success claims and demonstrate correct calendar merge behavior without suppressions.

**Full functional verification:** Produce fixture/queued/receipt/readback results through affected meeting actions, observe UI truth labels, and merge a mixed task/event dataset into Today/Upcoming without duplication or misclassification.

**Test method:** Core contract/calendar tests, adversarial result fixtures and a UI-to-RPC readback journey, followed by `bun x tsc --noEmit -p packages/core/tsconfig.json`.

### [QA-010.2] Fix downstream source contracts and include omitted workspace gates

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-and-independent-local-recheck.

**Observed branch progress:** PR1292/1317/1315/1319 and candidate1322 contain TypeScript/core/runtime fixes and qualified scoped gates; main-only 13/17/33/8 diagnostics must not be transferred unchanged to these heads.

**Requirements:** Resolve nullability/response-shape mismatches, meeting journal variants, voice runtime fetch/DOM assumptions, strict test narrowing and UI SDK/type drift identified in the independent package report. Distinguish missing workspace configuration from unsupported work; include all packages declared part of the final release.

**DoD:** Independently invoked checks and the complete root chain pass; no downstream check is skipped merely because an earlier package fails; production imports and target-specific runtime types agree.

**Full functional verification:** Create/update labels in a missing and valid workspace; save a messaging configuration; run manual/imported meetings; execute voice capture/transcription in desktop and web; reopen affected screens after restart.

**Test method:** Package-specific tsc matrix plus focused null/error-state tests and affected functional E2E. Deduplicate imported failures in triage and keep original logs as baseline evidence.

## [REL-001] Reconcile dependencies, executable supply chain and legal notices

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — partial-source-implementation.

**Observed branch progress:** PR1322 introduces exact staged-artifact SBOM, component decisions/notices and reusable license gate with separately trusted review/auditor revisions. This is source implementation, not an accepted signed release artifact audit.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Requirements:** A release has a complete resolved dependency/binary inventory, compatible target artifacts and accurate notices; accepted risks have owners and expiry. Complete both subtasks below and retain versioned evidence for every required target.

**DoD:** All subtask acceptance conditions pass on the same candidate, with implementation commits, observed outputs and any conditional exclusions recorded.

**Full functional verification:** Inspect installed app/container bundles, compare their hashes/versions with lockfile and dependency inventory, and invoke each bundled executable. Then Build from clean checkout, tamper a downloaded fixture binary, observe rejection, and verify artifact digest/signature against provenance.

**Test method:** SBOM generation plus artifact diff, license scanner and advisory review against primary package advisories; record exact resolved versions. Download integrity and CI secret redaction assertions plus independently verified final artifact manifest.

### [REL-001.1] Produce SBOM and review actual shipped dependencies

**Requirements:** Map UI/SVC/WIN/MAC/WEB/INT/QA/REL IDs to owner, implementation commit, target, test, artifact/log and residual issue.

**DoD:** Every required requirement is covered by verifiable evidence; conditional exclusions state the capability decision and user impact.

**Full functional verification:** Select each task row and reproduce its listed journey against the candidate; compare recorded outputs to its DoD.

**Test method:** Automated missing-evidence/status checks plus independent review of each release-critical flow and unresolved defect.

### [RECHECK-001.2] Reaudit changes after the pinned snapshot

**Reconciled implementation:** partially-implemented — reconciliation-in-progress.

**Observed branch progress:** This reconciliation inventories main, candidate changes, open PR heads and local dirty worktree paths; source010/a4ca/HEAD evidence identities are explicitly separated.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.

**Requirements:** Review merged changes since f63294b; delete obsolete tasks, update code anchors and rerun affected dependencies/flows instead of retaining stale claims.

**DoD:** Backlog describes the final tree and preserves historical baseline; every changed contract has updated evidence.

**Full functional verification:** Diff source to candidate commit, inspect changed handlers/adapters/packaging and run their mapped acceptance journeys.

**Test method:** Change-impact review with Git diff and task-to-code mapping; targeted integration reruns for changed contracts.

## [RECHECK-002] Reverify the exact release candidate artifacts and hosted deployment

**Reconciled implementation:** verification-required — prior-bounded-runtime-only.

**Observed branch progress:** Retained Linux standalone delivery and browser receipts are bounded to earlier exact commits. Current PR1322 native/perf jobs were cancelled, Vercel failed, and no final Win/Mac artifact or real hosted deployment acceptance is recorded. Independent de805 recheck: Bun1.4.2 server build passes but built-server lifecycle exits1 (3pass/1fail), startup ReferenceError exports_tmp undefined. CI-pinned Bun1.3.14 built-server lifecycle comparison now PASSes; Bun1.4.2 failure is version-specific observed compatibility risk. Qualify and enforce supported build/runtime versions.

**Integration status:** Full task release DoD is not closed on main; reviewed branch changes require explicit feature-preserving integration.

**Verification status:** A Windows 10/11, B signed/installed macOS and C hosted authenticated browser acceptance remains open unless a task-specific evidence packet explicitly proves its bounded subset. See [candidate check evidence](15-candidate-verification.md) for executed compiler/test subsets.
